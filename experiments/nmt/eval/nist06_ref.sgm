</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, feb. 6 (correspondents han jie and xu bo) on the 6th, reporters learned from the china banking regulatory commission that the measures for administration of e-banking business and the security evaluation guidance on e-banking issued recently by the cbrc will take effect on march 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> a cbrc spokesperson said that according to the rules of the measures for administration, relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged, that is, after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e-banking operations, if new types of e-banking operations need to be added, the main reporting office in china for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> in order to standardize e-banking operations of commercial banks, the people's bank of china promulgated the interim measures for administration of e-banking business in june 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the cbrc spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e-banking operations, the interim measures can no longer meet the requirements of e-banking risk supervision.  therefore, the cbrc formulated these two new rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> according to the introduction by the cbrc spokesperson, cbrc accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises.  it is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e-banking security evaluation business, but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> as long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements, even if it does not have cbrc accreditation, financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e-banking security evaluation, though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> the measures for administration of e-banking business include 99 articles under nine chapters, with the nine sections covering general provisions, applications and amendments, risk management, administration of data exchange and transfer, outsourcing business, administration of transnational business, supervision and management, legal obligations, and by-laws. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the security evaluation guidance on e-banking includes 57 articles under five chapters, with the five sections covering general provisions, security evaluation institutions, implementation of security evaluations, administration of security evaluation activities, and by-laws. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (selected excerpts from newspapers and magazines) shanghai: moonlighters and college graduates become main hourly workforce </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, feb. 7   the shanghai labor and social security bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th.  the number of job positions reached 120, 11 more than the previous time, while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> according to estimates by relevant experts at the shanghai labor and social security bureau, currently the number of hourly workers in shanghai has exceeded 1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to a china youth daily report, the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> a direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters, accounting for 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> in general, moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work.  for instance, among translation-related jobs, the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7%, while it has reached 61.6% for people in fitness professions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> high wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> it was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand.  most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people. </seg>
<seg id="10"> for example, mr. gu, a human resources manager in a company, spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> mr. gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field.  of course, the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> as some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent, they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs.  some 14% of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "at first i didn't want to be an hourly worker.  yet after working for a few months, i feel it is better than working from 9 to 5." </seg>
<seg id="14"> xiao huang, whose job after college was not satisfying, eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "i am quite satisfied with my current job.  it pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too.  what i need to do now is find a few more hourly positions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> it was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job-seeking graduates to accumulate work experience, practice work skills, enhance communication skills, and increase exposure to society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge-based and more technically focused positions.  for instance, specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> some hourly jobs require few skills, such as food salespeople and inventory workers.  laid-off workers can start work right after minimal training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> statistics show that among hourly workers, 39% were previously laid-off workers.  among them, the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4%, while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7%.  hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> chinese experts: us playing up "china military threat" is groundless accusation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, feb. 9 (correspondents li xuanliang, xiong zhengyan, and lin liping) in the quadrennial defense review that the us pentagon has officially submitted to congress recently, china was for the first time called "an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states." </seg>
<seg id="3"> experts think this is a groundless accusation against china's normal national defense construction.  it plays up "china military threat" and interferes in china's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon's new national defense guideline document. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the 92-page-long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on china's military issues and the countermeasures the united states should take.  directly mentioning the two phrases of "china" or "chinese" 15 times, the report said that "as a major and emerging power, china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states.  if the united states does not have countermeasures, china will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy us advantages in conventional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> yao yunzhu, a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the chinese military academy of sciences, said that though senior us officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier, this is the first time the united states proposed in its "national defense strategy report" that "china is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "the report for the first time explicitly refers to russia, india and china as emerging strategic rivals; in particular, more attention was given to the so-called 'china military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said major general peng guangqian, a research fellow with the chinese military academy of sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> noticeably, on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted, us president bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress, with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion us dollars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "if the additional budget for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is added, the us national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars, an all time high," peng guangqian said. "that is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> peng guanqian thinks that the fabrication of "foreign threats" by the united states reflected the pentagon's habitual style of "making enemies" and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge us arms industry groups can fish for more profits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the united states, china's national defense expenditures are quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> deng hongzhou, a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on china's national defense, said that china's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s, but the proportion it takes in the state national budget for the same period is on the decline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> official statistics show that compared with 1979, the proportion of china's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the state budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> in 2005 china's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion rmb, only about 1/14 of that of the united states.  its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the united states, and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a us soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "the united states is equal to china in terms of territorial area, but there is such a big difference in military expenditures.  it is self-evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs." </seg>
<seg id="17"> peng guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> teng jianqun, director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association, said that the united states should evaluate china's military construction situation objectively and that china's peaceful development doesn't necessarily mean that china and the united states will become military antagonists in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> china's 2004 white paper on national defense says that china firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. </seg>
<seg id="20"> china has never threatened any country in the past and at present, and will never do so in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> so far china has not set up any military base in any other country, nor has china dispatched a single soldier to other countries.  in contrast, the united states has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in asia alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> zhu feng, a professor of the international relations institute of peking university, said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the china-us constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> xinhua news agency correspondents wang hao and huang min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> after the palestinian islamic resistance movement (hamas) won the legislative council elections, how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> what new policies hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in the meantime, resistance by the us and israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> at present, various parties in palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subtitle) who will become prime minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between "prime minister hamas" and current top leader abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> in addition, hamas leader mashal, who is currently visiting egypt, stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel.  this strong message also increased international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power, threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> however, this did not hinder hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment, selecting an independent individual as a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> according to reports, in order to obtain maximum international recognition, hamas leaders both at home and abroad, who recently gathered in egypt, decided to select independent jamal al-khudairi, board chairman of the islamic university in gaza, as new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister, the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard-line stance of hamas.  only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (subtitle) how to divide power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> internally, the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> an article carried in the palestinian newspaper al-ayyam analyzed that although hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs, it lacks experience in governance.  it would be wise for it to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement (fatah), which has experience in governance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> following the elections, hamas proposed establishing a "political partnership" with fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government.  however, fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet.  one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move, while another faction rejects the hamas invitation, preferring to be an "active opposition" in the legislative council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> sources noted that under abbas's persuasion, fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> in spite of this, hamas and fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> in addition, another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council, breaking away from partisan affiliations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> according to reports, hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts, but the specific name list is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> based on us and israeli attitudes, forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law, after the new legislative council assumes power on the 16th of this month, the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (subtitle) what about arms? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> the weapons it possesses is another tough issue hamas faces in forming the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the us and israel are very firm in their positions, resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government. </seg>
<seg id="30"> hamas leader mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> the issue of weapons actually exists on two levels, the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the legislative council through democratic and free methods.  the way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction az a-din al-qassam brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a "people's army" of the palestinian national authority, yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad (jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> at present, palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel, most of whom come from the fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> in addition, fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions, such as al-aqsa martyrs' brigades and the fatah hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must reach a consensus with abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> according to local media reports, abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces, while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> however, the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue, with no outcome so far. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> the report noted that after more than 20 years, china's polar exploration "has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale," forming a "three stations, one vessel" system on antarctica and arctic exploration, namely, the changcheng station in the antarctic established in february 1985 and the zhongshan station in the antarctic established in february 1989, and the huanghe station built in july 2004 in the arctic, as well as the "xuelong" polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for antarctic and arctic exploration since 1994. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, tokyo, feb. 13 (correspondent qian zheng) researchers at japan's tokai university have developed a type of bio-artificial kidney, which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but also the function of preserving useful substances.  in addition it is small in size and easy to transplant.  with further research, there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> according to a recent nikkei business daily report, the newly-developed bio-artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts, an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine, such as water and amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="4"> both the "artificial nephron" and the "artificial renal tubule" are made of hollow fibers.  in addition, the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis-related amyloidosis, a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis, into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose, vitamins, and minerals the body needs. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in contrast, previous artificial kidneys, depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste, were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> researchers tested the bio-artificial kidney transplant on goats, using a pig's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, feb. 13 (correspondent an bei) a senior official from the state electricity regulatory commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005, safe power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> at the fifth (expanded) meeting of the national commission for safe power production held here, serc vice chairman shi yubo said that in 2005 china's power production safety was generally stable, while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished.  active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters, and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured.  accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year-on-year basis, and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> nevertheless, he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly-built power generator units added in succession, safe power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> included in these challenges are: regional, seasonal, and periodic power shortages will continue to exist; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems, while at the same time, the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control, with the situation remaining grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> shi yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform, many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge.  how to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> with regard to power production safety work in 2006, shi yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> it was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation, this year the serc will carry out revision and improvement of the provisional regulations on investigation of power production accidents that were issued.  meanwhile, supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> in 2005, electricity consumption by all sectors in china reached 2,468.9 gigawatt-hours, up 13.45% year-on-year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand, and increasing problems with coal, electricity, and oil transportation, various power producers took effective measures, stepping up management of infrastructure.  in all of last year, throughout the country, no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> there were 74 grid accidents, down 127 cases year-on-year, and 427 infrastructure accidents, down 132 cases year-on-year. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> since 2006, four chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in south africa.  chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in response to this, the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and also reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further step up vigilance, enhance unity and friendship among chinese compatriots, and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="13"> according to the briefing by nyembezi, tourism attache of the south african embassy, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to chinese nationals going to south africa in the first 15 days alone of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> in addition, according to the chinese official statistics, south africa continued to maintain its position as china's largest trade partner in africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion us dollars, growing 23% year-on-year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> however, tourism professionals think that the serial killings of chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of chinese tourists to south africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> according to the statistics of south africa's tourism bureau, the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331, a 14.9% year-on-year decrease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> currently, some 200,000 chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across south africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor, high unemployment rate, rampant use of guns, and lack of death penalty in south africa. </seg>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of restructuring and shutting down. </seg>
<seg id="9"> resolutely and tightly shut down every one of the 5,243 coalmines which have been publicly announced and the other 700-plus coalmines widely reported recently. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --enhance basic coalmine safety administration. </seg>
<seg id="12"> promptly rectify and halt administrative declines in a handful of large state-owned coalmines and guide small coalmines with chaotic management to set up standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> in particular, emphasis should be placed on key state-owned coalmines, absolutely prohibiting production that exceeds capacity, exceeds the intensity threshold, and exceeds the established number of workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> this year's work safety control targets call for a reduction of the nationwide death toll from various kinds of accidents by 3% from the previous year, with a reduction of 3.5% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths should be reduced by 5%, with a reduction of 7% for coalmines. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, turin, feb. 17 news analysis: pyleva case likely to end where it is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> xinhua correspondents gao peng and ding ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> although italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the turin winter olympics may face "prison sentences," based on various circumstances at this time, such fate is unlikely to happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva, the center of the first stimulant scandal at this winter olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> on the 16th, the first stimulant scandal broke out at the turin winter olympics when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedon, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the next day the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics.  in addition, she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women's 15 km event she won at this winter olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> on the same day, the international biathlon union decided to give pyleva a two-year ban from the competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> it has always been the ioc regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the olympic games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete, but they are not subject to legal sanctions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> however, under italian law, athletes' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts.  prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants, and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> in december last year, after "bargaining" for a year, the ioc and the italian government finally reached an agreement, under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this winter olympics in accordance with the italian law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> through the untiring efforts of the ioc, the italian side made concession four days before the winter olympics opened, promising that police would not enter the olympic village to raid athletes' quarters during the winter olympics, but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> some reports said that pescante, an italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics, has already turned over the case of pyleva using stimulant to turin's prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, the ioc and pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that pyleva has already left turin for her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> shi kangcheng, a chinese sports official who formerly worked at the world anti-doping agency for many years, thinks that once pyleva returns to her country, this incident may eventually "end where it is." </seg>
<seg id="16"> shi kangcheng said that the ioc and the italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant issue at the winter olympics.  even if the italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case, the outcome is still hard to tell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> based on italy's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse, the maximum penalties violators got were only "two-year deferred imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> therefore, piaili, a senior reporter from the italian news agency ansa, said that there is "little" chance that pyleva will go to jail.  she would just face fines at maximum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> piaili also said that although the italian court can hold a trial in absentia, the italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, the italian side will not be able to do anything to her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> a spokesman for the banking supervision committee said that based on the management method regulations, the approval method for foreign financial institutions is unchanged, i.e. if a branch of a foreign bank is approved to establish an online banking business and it needs to add a new service item for the online banking business, the major unit that reports to the branch in china's territory should be solely responsible for the application and review. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> the "method for management of electronic banking businesses" has a total of nine chapters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts, including the general principle, application and renewal, risk control, data exchange and transfer control, business contract control, cross-border business activities control, supervision control, liabilities, and additional regulations, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (newspaper digest) part-time workers and high school graduates become major forces of hourly-paid work in shanghai </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, february 7. the "guidance on the current standard for hourly-paid wages in 2006" issued by the labor and social support bureau of shanghai city on february 6, lists 120 occupations, which is 11 more than the number issued last time. the "wage levels" of the original positions are either increased or reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> as an estimate made by related experts of the labor and social support bureau of shanghai city, currently the hourly-paid workers in shanghai are more than one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> as china youth journal reported, part-time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of hourly-paid labors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> through a direct survey of more than 8,000 hourly-paid workers, more than half of them are part-time workers, and their ratio is 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> those part-time workers are generally well educated, and mainly do more technical work. for instance, the ratio of part-time workers in the translation occupation is as high as 81.7%, and that in the gym business is 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> high income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at hourly-paid part-time jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> as was learned, monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of yuan, and it is difficult to find high-demand talents, such as simultaneous interpreters; most hourly-paid workers' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 yuan, such as part-time financial workers, wedding ceremony managers, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> one of the important reasons for the popularity of part-time workers for hourly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> for instance, mr. gu, who is a manager of the human resources unit at a company, uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week. </seg>
<seg id="11"> mr. gu thinks that the greatest benefit of a part-time job is to continuously renew his own knowledge, and has opportunities to know another field, and of course, a monthly income of 2,000 yuan is also attractive to a certain extent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> since some positions for hourly-paid workers are low-skill ones, and their working patterns are flexible and free, they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs. 14% of hourly-paid workers are graduates from colleges and polytechnic schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "i did not want to do an hourly-paid job in the beginning. but several months later, i feel it is better than 9 to 5 work." </seg>
<seg id="14"> xiao huang's job hunting is not that satisfying after he graduates from college. he eventually registers with a hotel and plays background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "i am quite satisfied with my current work, 100 yuan per hour, and the environment is also good. what i should do now is to find several more hourly-paid jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> as has been learned, hourly-paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumulate work experience, exercise their work skills, improve their communication skills, and enrich their social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> those graduates who work at hourly-paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills, including translation positions, which require professional skills, and entertainment and performance positions, which require current popularity. these two kinds of positions are 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively, among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> some positions for hourly-paid workers do not require high skills, such as food promotion workers, merchandise handlers, and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple trainings. </seg>
<seg id="19"> data shows that those hourly-paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39% of the total hourly-paid workers; among them, workers who used to work in retail business are 68.4%; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 58.7%. the hourly-paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment. </seg>

<seg id="1"> china's experts: "china's military threat" touted by the united states is an unreasonable accusation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, february 9 (reporters: li xuanliang, xiong zhengyan, lin liping). the quadrennial defense review formally submitted by the united states pentagon to the congress a few days ago first calls china "a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the united states militarily." </seg>
<seg id="3"> experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against china's normal defense construction, and an interference in china's internal affairs by exaggerating the "theory of china's military threat." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> the quadrennial defense review is a new guidance document for national defense of the pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this 92-page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of china's military strength and how the united states should cope with it. the report directly mentions the two terms of "china" and "chinese" 15 times, and says that, "as a major newly arisen power, china has the most military potential to compete with the united states; if the united states does not take any countermeasures, china is very likely to develop destructive military technology, and break the us supremacy of traditional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> yao yunzhu, a research fellow at the world's military study office of china's military science academy, said that although senior us officials expressed similar views before, this is the first time for the united states to come up with the idea that "china is most likely to challenge the united states militarily as a newly arisen power" in a defense strategy report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "this report first regards russia, india, and china as newly arisen strategic rivals, and especially, pays more attention to the so-called 'theory of china's military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said major general peng guangqian, a research fellow at china's military science academy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> the noticeable thing is that on the same day when the quadrennial defense review was submitted, us president bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the congress, and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "if the budget for military activities in iraq and afghanistan is added, the defense budget for the us in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars," said peng guangqian. "and this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> peng guangqian thinks that the us method of making "theories of threats from other countries" reflects its consistent style of "making enemies," and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the us's gigantic defense industry groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the us, china's military expenditure is quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> deng hongzhou, a military expert who has participated in the writing of the china defense white paper many times, said that since the 90s of the 20th century, with the economic development, china's defense funding has been increased to some extent, but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state's financial expenditure in the same periods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979, the ratio of china's defense expenditure in the state's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> china's defense funding in 2005 was rmb 244.656 billion yuan, which only amounts to 1/14 of that of the us; military expense per capita is only equal to 1/60 of that of the us; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1/30 of that of the us armed forces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "the us land area is about as big as china's, but the gap in military expenditures between (the two countries) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> said peng guangqian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> teng jianqun, director of the study office at china's armament control and disarmament association, said that the us side should objectively comment on china's military construction, and china's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military rivals in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> china's defense white paper 2004 says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> china never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> china has never established any military bases in any other countries so far, nor sent any troops to other countries; but the united states has established more than a hundred overseas military bases, and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> zhu feng, a professor at the international relations college of beijing university, said that both china and the united states should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust, thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between china and the united states in the new century, and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, ramallah, february 9 (international observation). hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> xinhua news agency reporters: wang hao and huang min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> how the palestinian islamic resistance movement (hamas) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the legislative committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to. </seg>
<seg id="5"> what kind of a new policy hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at the same time, the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has made the prospect of the hamas government more uncertain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> currently, all the parties in palestine are consulting each other tensely, and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subtitle) who will be selected to take the position of prime minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> some outsiders worry that a "hamas prime minister" might have disagreements with abbas, the current supreme leader, after hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> moreover, a hamas leader, mushir, who is visiting egypt, stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel. this strong signal has also raised more international concerns. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that controls real power, and threatened to stop their economic aid to palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the palestinian side. </seg>
<seg id="12"> however, these things do not hinder hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly. selection of an independent candidate is one compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> as it has been reported, to win maximum acknowledgement internationally, the hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in egypt a few days ago, had decided to select jamal al-khudairi, an independent person who is the chair of the board of gaza islamic university, to be the new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> this move has not been responded to by related parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> hussein, a palestinian analyst, said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister, the most important thing is to soften the "strong" attitude of hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister, and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (subtitle) how to allocate power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="18"> an article published by the palestinian daily journal analyzed that although hamas has won support from people through social welfare items, it lacks administrative experience, and a better strategy is to collaborate with the palestinian national liberation movement (fatah), which has administrative experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> hamas suggested to establish a "political partnership" with fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election, but fatah has not actively responded to it so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> inside fatah, there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an "active opposition" in the legislative committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> a well-informed source pointed out that fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after abbas's persuasion. </seg>
<seg id="22"> even so, fatah will bargain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> moreover, another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of partisan leanings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> as it has been reported, hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government, but the concrete name list of the government is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> because of the attitude of the united states and israel, a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to regulations of the palestinian "essential law," nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new legislative committee assumes office on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (subtitle) where does the armed wing go? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of hamas. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the attitude of the united states and israel is very strong, and they firmly request that hamas give up violence, and refuse its joining the government with its weapons. </seg>
<seg id="30"> hamas leader mushir stressed on the 9th that the armed resistance is the "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> the armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the legislative committee through a democratic and free method, and the legitimatized path for its armed wing, the qassam brigades, is to integrate it into a security organization for the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a "people's army" under the palestinian national authority, but it has not received broad responses, and has even been criticized by the palestinian islamic organization (jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations, and most of them come from the fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> moreover, fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them, such as the "al-aqsa martyr brigades" and "fatah hawks," etc. </seg>
<seg id="36"> hamas, responsible for the cabinet organization, must make an agreement with abbas on how to control those self-governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> as local media reported, abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the internal affairs ministry of a new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> however, all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue, and have not produced any results. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, february 13 (reporter: an pei). a leader of the state power supervision and control committee said on the 13th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005, secure power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> vice chairman of the state power supervision and control committee shi yubo said at the fifth (expanded) session of the national secure power production committee that in 2005 china's secure power production was stable in general, and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the summertime, realized a secure power supply, actively coped with the strikes of natural disasters, and basically assured the secure and stable operation of power systems, greatly reduced equipment accidents in secure power production and general power network accidents, compared with those of last year, and the health level of power equipment was increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> but he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations, and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another, secure power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> these challenges include: regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortages still exist; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed, supply of power and coal is still quite problematic; at the same time, the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled, and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets; some power network structures are fragile and their equipment is obsolete, which brings risks to systems' safety; frequent occurrences of accidents in power infrastructure construction have not completely changed, and the situation is still serious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> shi yubo said that with the further development of power system reform, many deep-rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed, and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> for the secure power production work in 2006, shi yubo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perfected to strengthen responsive capabilities for emergencies; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened; security of big dams should be assured; safety control of power facility constructions should be strengthened to reduce occurrences of personnel injury and death accidents; information delivery work should be continuously strengthened to assure the accurate, timely, and smooth flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> it has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation, this year the power supervision and control committee will revise and perfect the issued temporary regulations on accident investigation of power production, and at the same time will continuously issue and execute additional documents about the safety of the hydraulic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, february 13 (reporters: wang jiangang and hao yalin). charge d'affaires ad interim and minister of the south african embassy in china vusi bruce koloane said in an interview with xinhua news agency reporters on the 13th that there are no "organized" criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> he said at the same time that the south african government will make every effort to "strike against all forms of criminal activities." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> vusi bruce koloane stated that the south african government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero," and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in south africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> since 2006, 4 chinese citizens have been killed, one after another, in south africa, and the chinese world has broadly paid attention to it. </seg>
<seg id="6"> china's foreign ministry has contacted the south african side about the matter, and warned chinese citizens who are traveling in south africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection, and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas chinese, and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "we express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> vusi bruce koloane said, "we are sorry for this, and we also want the chinese people to believe that the south african government is carefully investigating every case related to the chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> as the embassy of south africa presented, the south african police have successfully broken a case in which chen jianqing, a woman came from fujian, china, was killed on february 5 in south africa, and have arrested a suspect. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the police are searching for another suspect at present. </seg>
<seg id="11"> as the south african embassy in china disclosed, the suspect, who is charged with the gun death of a hong kong businessman in january of this year, has been arrested by the south african police, and the belongings of the victim have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> when talking about the possible impacts of the killings of chinese citizens, vusi bruce koloane thinks that those incidents will "indeed" impact trade, tourism, and exchanges in other fields between the two countries, and produce negative outcomes. but in the long run, those impacts "should not be big." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> as tourist attache of the south african embassy nian beixi presented, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for chinese to go to south africa in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> based on the statistical data of the chinese government, south africa had maintained its number one status as china's biggest trade partner in africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion usd, and increased 23% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> however, people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited south africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> based on the statistics of the sightseeing bureau of south africa, there were 20,331 chinese tourists who visited south africa in the first half of 2005, which were reduced 14.9% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> there are about 200,000 chinese who live in south africa at present, and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of south africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in south african society, and a high unemployment rate, guns are spread everywhere, and no death penalty, the crime rate is still high there. </seg>
<seg id="20"> because many chinese do not speak english, and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes, they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, beijing, february 15 (reporters: zhou wei and li fei). many networks and websites currently rely on republishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their click rates, but many of them are neither authorized, nor pay related fees. to cope with this, director of the copyright department of the state copyright bureau wang ziqiang said in a press conference, held by the news office of the state council on the 15th, that the state council will explain about the implementation of the protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks, on the issue of paying for republishing works on the internet. </seg>

<seg id="5"> according to related interpretations made by the people's supreme court, the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the internet, i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the internet, whose authors did not state that "they cannot be used," the internet can use them without permission, but at the same time needs to pay their authors. </seg>
<seg id="6"> but because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard, the internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, turin, february 17. news analysis: pyleva incident might be settled by leaving it unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> xinhua news agency reporters: gao peng, ding ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> although italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the "disaster of being jailed," many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to russian women's biathlon athlete olga pyleva, who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the winter olympic games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the first stimulant use scandal at the turin winter olympic games was exposed on the 16th, and olga pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the next day, the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been thrown out of the winter olympic games, and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women's biathlon had been withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the same day, the international winter biathlon alliance determined to forbid pyleva to participate in the sport for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> the international olympic committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants, they will lose their qualification to participate in the games, and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn, but they are not subject to legal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="9"> however, according to italian law, the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities. a law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants. any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> the international olympic committee had been "bargaining" with the italian government for one year, and eventually reached an agreement last december. both sides agreed that during the period of the winter olympic games, any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> through the unremitting efforts made by the international olympic committee, the italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the winter olympic games, and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search athlete residences during the olympic games. but any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by italian prosecution organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> some reports said that pescante, an official of the italian government responsible for supervision of the turin winter olympic games, has transferred pyleva's stimulant case to a turin prosecution organization. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, the international olympic committee and pescante himself have not confirmed this so far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> andrey dmytriev, a doctor for the russian biathlon team ,disclosed at noontime on the 17th that pyleva had left turin and returned home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> shi kangcheng, a chinese sports official who had been in a position at the world anti-stimulant organization for many years, thinks that once pyleva returns home, this case might eventually "be settled by leaving it unsettled." </seg>
<seg id="16"> shi kangcheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have not "completely addressed" the anti-stimulant issue at the winter olympic games, and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> based on past penalty cases in which italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants, the most serious penalty was merely a "two-year probation." </seg>
<seg id="18"> thus, senior reporter piali from the italian ansa said that the possibility of pyleva being jailed is "very small," and at most, she might be fined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> piali also said that although an italian court could sentence her by default, it is impossible for the italian police to catch pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> if pyleva refuses to accept the sentence, the italian side can do nothing about it. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (newspaper excerpt锛塖hanghai: part-timers and university grads become main source of hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> beijing, feb. 7 (xinhua) the shanghai bureau of labor and social security released on the 6th the "2006 most recent guidance for hourly wages". it covers 120 kinds of positions--11 more than the last edition--and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> according to estimates by experts at the shanghai bureau of labor and social security, the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> china youth daily has reported that university graduates and part-timers are the main source of hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part-timers, with the percentage reaching 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> the educational level of these part-timers is generally high, with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work, in which part-timers make up 81.7% of the manpower.  in the fitness industry, they occupy up to 61.6% of the positions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> high income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part-time work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> according to sources, the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply. simultaneous interpretation is one such example. the monthly income for most hourly positions--such as part-time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony--can reach 2000 yuan or more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> another important reason that hourly part-time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one's knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="10"> for example, mr. gu, manager of an enterprise's human resources department, spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> mr. gu says the greatest benefits of part-time work are the continuous upgrading of one's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field. of course, the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements, they are gradually finding favor with many job-seeking graduates. fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "initially, i wasn't interested in hourly work. but after a few months, i feel that it is better than a nine-to-five job." </seg>
<seg id="14"> after young huang graduated from university, he could not find a job he liked. finally, he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "at 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment, i am very satisfied with my job. what i need now is to find more hourly jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> according to reports, hourly jobs have become an important route for job-hunting graduates to accumulate work experience, hone their work skills, improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills, such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work. these two fields account for 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> some hourly positions, such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks, do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> data shows that the unemployed make up 39% of hourly workers. the proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4% in retail-related positions and 58.7% in catering-related positions. hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> chinese experts: us making groundless accusations by playing up "china military threat" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> beijing, feb. 9 (xinhua)  (reporters: li xuanliang, xiong zhengyan, lin liping) in the quadrennial defense review it formally submitted recently to congress, the us pentagon has said for the first time that china is "the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states." </seg>
<seg id="3"> experts say this is unreasonable finger-pointing at china's normal defense construction, an exaggeration of the "chinese military threat" and an interference in china's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon's new national defense guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the 92-page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of china's military and the countermeasures the united states should take. the report makes 15 direct references to "china" or "chinese" and says that "as an important emerging power, china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states. if the united states fails to take countermeasures, china will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional u.s. military advantages". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> yao yunzhu, researcher with the department of world military research at the chinese academy of military sciences, said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions, this is the first time that the us has said in the defense report that "china is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "it is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to russia, india and china as rising strategic opponents and, in particular, focused more on the so-called 'chinese military threat'," </seg>
<seg id="8"> said major general peng guangqian, a researcher at the chinese academy of military sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> worthy of note is that on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted, us president bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress. it included us$439.3bn earmarked for national defense. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "if the budget supplemented for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is included, the american national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top us$500bn to reach an all-time high," peng guangqian said. "this is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world's countries." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> peng guangqian says fabrication of "foreign threats" by the united states reflects the pentagon's consistent  style of "manufacturing  enemies", and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the colossal weapons industry groups of the united states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the united states, china's national defense spending is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> military expert deng hongzhou, who has participated several times in the compilation of the white book on chinese national defense, said that since the 1990s china's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed, but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall downward trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> official data shows that compared with 1979, the proportion that china's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> in 2005, china's national defense expenditure was rmb244.656bn, equal to only 1/14 that of the us; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1/60 that of the us and military expenditure per serviceman was equal to 1/30 that of the us military. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "the us is about as large as china in terms of territory, but the difference in their military spending is so great. it is self-evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> peng guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> teng jianqun, director of the research department of the china association of armament control and disarmament, says that the us should objectively evaluate china's military construction and adds that china's peaceful development does not mean that china and the us will become military adversaries in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the 2004 china national defense white book says that china keeps firmly to the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> china is no threat to any country, either in the past, at present or in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> to date, china has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country. in contrast, the us keeps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in asian alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> professor zhu feng of the college of international relations, beijing university says china and the us should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange, improve mutual understanding and trust, promote a constructive sino-us partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development. </seg>

<seg id="2"> ramallah, feb. 9 (xinhua)(international observation) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (xinhua reporters: wang hao, huang min) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> following the victory of palestine's islamic resistance movement (hamas) in parliamentary elections, how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> what kind of policies hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at the same time, the resistant attitude of the us and israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the hamas-lead government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> at present, the different palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subhead) who will become prime minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> since hamas won the right to form a cabinet, some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the "hamas prime minister" and the palestinian leader, abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> in addition, the leader of hamas, mashaal, who is currently visiting egypt, stressed that a palestinian government formed by the leaders of hamas would not recognize israel, a hard-line signal that heightened international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the us and israel have clearly stated they will not accept a hamas-led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues. </seg>
<seg id="12"> but this has not prevented hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments, including a compromise policy of selecting independents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> according to reports, in order to maximize recognition from the international community, in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of hamas gathered in egypt decided to select an independent figure, ismail haniyeh, chairman of the board of gaza islamic university, to become the new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> concerned parties have not yet responded to the move. </seg>
<seg id="15"> palestinian analyst hisham said that, whoever takes over the prime-ministership, the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down hamas' hard-line character, since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (subhead) how will authority be distributed? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> from an internal perspective, the biggest challenge faced by the hamas-led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> an analysis in an article in the palestinian daily al-ayyam said that hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office. cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement, or fatah, will be the best solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> after the election, hamas raise the possibility of a "political partnership" with fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government, but until now fatah has not given a positive response. </seg>
<seg id="20"> fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet. one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be "an active opposition" in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="21"> informed sources say fatah, with persuasion coming from abbas, is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> even so, hamas and fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation. </seg>
<seg id="24"> according to reports, hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts, but the actual name list is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> in view of us and israeli attitudes, a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside. </seg>
<seg id="26"> palestine's basic law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (subhead) how do the weapons fit in? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> hamas' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the us and israel have an extremely hard-line attitude, insisting that hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> the leader of hamas, mashaal, emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the organization's "strategic choice". </seg>
<seg id="31"> the issue of weapons in reality includes two levels:  the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> that hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally. it will, through similarly legal methods, try to integrate its armed branch, the al-qassam brigade, into the government's security apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="33"> hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a palestinian national force, or "people's army", but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the palestine islamic jihad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel, the vast majority of which are from the fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> in addition, fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al-aqsa martyrs brigade and the fatah hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> responsible for forming a cabinet, hamas will have to come to terms with fatah regarding how to manage these various self-governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> according to local media reports, abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces. the police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> but the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> tokyo, february 13 (xinhua)(reporter: qian zheng) researchers at tokai university in japan have developed a bioartificial kidney. it not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components. additionally, it is small in size and easy to transplant. as more detailed research is carried out, there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> according to a recent report by the japan light industry news, the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts. one part is composed of "artificial nephrons" that filter metabolic matter and water from blood; the other part consists of the "artificial renal tubules" the extracts water, amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread. the inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis --dialysis-related amyloidosis-- to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood. at the same time, it can also cause the glucose, vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in the past, artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely. they were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood. </seg>

<seg id="1"> safe electricity production in china still faced with difficult challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> beijing, feb. 13 (xinhua)(reporter: an pei) an official with the state electricity regulatory commission (serc) said on the 13th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005, it still faces difficult challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> serc vice chairman shi yubo said at the fifth (expanded) meeting of the national electricity safe production committee held here that china's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005, with the task of supplying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized. the impact of natural disasters was actively countered, thereby essentially ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power system. accidents involving safe power production equipment or the general power grid showed a dramatic year-on-year reduction, while the health of power equipment was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> but he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power-generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> these challenges include the following: electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region-specific, season-specific and time-specific basis; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them; at the same time, the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control, seriously affecting the stable operation of power-generating sets; the weak structure and outdated equipment of some power grids cause hidden problems in system safety; the frequent occurrence of accidents in the construction of electric power infrastructure has not been turned around and the situation remains grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> shi yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system. the new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal, orderly production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> discussing about the safe production of electric power in 2006, shi yubo said it was necessary to further strengthen basic initiatives for the management of safe power production; speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency control mechanism for electricity safety and enhance emergency reaction capabilities; step up coordination and team work between plants and grids in the joint maintenance of the safety of the electricity system; continue a high standard of safety supervision and informatization efforts for hydroelectric dams in order to ensure dam safety; tighten control over safety in electricity-related construction work so as to reduce casualties; and continue to reinforce the submission of information to ensure the accuracy, timeliness and smooth communication of electricity safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> according to reports, in keeping with the new situation in electricity safety management, cerc will this year revise and improve the already promulgated interim regulations on investigations into electricity production accidents. at the same time, cerc will also issue support documents concerning the safety of hydroelectric dams and the safety protection of secondary electricity systems this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> the power consumption of chinese society in 2005 reached 2.4689 trillion kwh, registering a year-on-year rise of 13.45%. </seg>
<seg id="10"> confronted with the tautness of power supply and prominent difficulties in the transportation of coals and fuels, electric power enterprises took effective measures to improve equipment management so that all last year no major equipment accident occurred in the national electricity production . </seg>
<seg id="11"> there were 74 power grid accidents, representing a year-on-year decrease of 127, and 427 equipment accidents, for a year-on-year decrease of 132. </seg>

<seg id="2"> beijing, feb. 13 (xinhua)(reporters: wang jiangang, hao yalin) vusi b. koloane, charge d'affaires of the south african embassy in china, said on the 13th in an exclusive interview with a xinhua reporter that there in no organized criminal effort against chinese nationals in south africa. </seg>

<seg id="4"> vusi b. koloane said that the south african government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero" and wants the safety of the lives and property of every foreigner working in south africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> so far, four chinese citizens have been murdered in south africa in 2006, causing a widespread expression of concern from the chinese community. </seg>
<seg id="6"> china's ministry of foreign affairs has raised the issue with south africa and warned chinese citizens traveling to south africa to be more aware of safety precautions. it also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "we express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed." </seg>
<seg id="8"> vusi b. koloane said, "we feel sorry for what has happened and ask the chinese people to believe that the government of south africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> according to the chinese embassy in south africa, south african police have successfully solved the case of chen jianqing, a woman from fujian, china who was murdered in south africa on february 5. one suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> police are currently hunting another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> furthermore, the south african embassy in china has revealed that south african police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a hong kong businessman in january this year and that the victim's possessions have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> speaking of the impact that the killing of chinese citizens might have, vusi b. koloane said that the incidents would "definitely" have a negative impact on business, tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries, but the impact would "probably be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> according to manqoba nyembezi, tourism attache with the south african embassy in china, the south african embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> according to official chinese statistics, south africa continued to remain china's largest trade partner in africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> bilateral trade grew 23% year-on-year to us$7.27bn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> however, tourism industry sources said the serial killings of chinese citizens in south africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to south africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> statistics from the south african tourism board show that 20,331 chinese tourists visited south africa in the first half of 2005, representing a year-on-year decrease of 14.9%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> approximately 200,000 chinese currently live in south africa. they are spread throughout south africa's cities, town and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in south african society, high unemployment, the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent. </seg>
<seg id="20"> because many chinese do not understand english, they keep cash on their person and in their homes, making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money. </seg>

<seg id="6"> an investigation has revealed that the incident began on that day at approximately 1630hrs when electricity to the liaoyuan central hospital suddenly stopped. according to the hospital's circuitry design, if power is cut, the switch in the transformer box automatically activates a backup switch that maintains the normal supply of power to the hospital. in this case, the backup switch failed to automatically activate and electrician team supervisor zhang diankun forced the resumption of power without checking the cause of the outage. this resulted in the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> furthermore, there were more than ten cables that were tangled together among the underground electrical cables that were giving off smoke. this kind of electrical cable should be neatly arranged and a fire protection layer should be installed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> for this reason, three other individual will also be prosecuted for gross negligence: 57-year-old zhao yongchun, electrical installation team supervisor at the liaoyuan textile company; sun fenglin, a retired official (senior engineer) for the liaoyuan electricity bureau; and jin chengtai, retired employee of the liaoyuan central hospital who was later rehired. </seg>

<seg id="2"> beijing, february 16 (xinhua)(reporter: chen jianxing) the economic administration authorities of the taiwan government decided on the 15th to fine united microelectronics corporations (umc)--one of the "two titans of taiwan's chip industry"--nt$5 million for "unlawfully aiding and participating in the establishment" of he jian technology in mainland china. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> taiwan's china times reported that this is the first time taiwan authorities have penalized a taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since chen shui-bian came up with a stance of advocating a cross-strait economic policy of "active management, effective liberalization". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to the report, individuals attached to the investment commission of taiwan's ministry of economic affairs said umc was fined because it had violated the statute governing relations between the people of the taiwan area and the mainland area as well as the measures governing investment or technical cooperation in mainland china. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the investment commission will fine umc's former chairman tsao hsing-cheng and others after reviewing the situation. </seg>

<seg id="6"> the "umc case" began in february, 2005, when taiwanese investigators sent nearly a hundred people to raid the homes and offices of several umc executives, saying umc was suspected of "illegally providing funds, technology and human resources" to hejian technology, a mainland company in which umc had invested. </seg>
<seg id="7"> umc's chairman at the time, tsao hsing-cheng, publicly stated after the event that umc had not breached any of the taiwan government's regulations and that umc's help to hejian technology was in umc's long-term interest because umc would lose business opportunities if it failed to quickly enter the mainland market. </seg>
<seg id="8"> afterwards, the taiwan government's financial supervisory commission fined umc nt$3 million for contravening regulations on the disclosure of business information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> umc's board accepted tsao hsing-cheng's resignation on january 9, 2006. a few hours later, tsao hsing-cheng was officially indicted for alleged illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> beijing, feb. 17 (xinhua)(reporter: liu zheng) following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people, the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made "curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents" the most urgent task in national work safety this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> this reporter was informed on the 17th by the state administration of work safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> to make coal mines safer this year, the state administration of work safety will take a strong hold over the following three items: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas. </seg>
<seg id="6"> control of gas this year must give prominence to "draining gas before mining coal". </seg>
<seg id="7"> if high gassy mines fail to "drain gas before mining coal", they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the 5243 coal-mine and coal-pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one, as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> closures must become a part of routine work, with coal mines that destroy resources, pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --strengthen administration of coal-mine safety infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="12"> the deterioration of management in the small number of large state-owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled, while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> in particular, key state-owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity, strength or manpower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> the safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3% drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents, including a 3.5% drop in accidents in coal mines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5%, while in the coal mines they must decrease 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> these control standards have been transmitted to the people's governments of the various provinces. the various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005, which represents a 0.7% decrease year on year. </seg>

<seg id="4"> italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the turin winter olympics could face a "prison term", but judging from things as they stand now, chances are slim that this will happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva, leading figure in the first doping scandal of these winter olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> on the 16th, the turin winter olympics saw its first doping scandal uncovered when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedron, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the following day, the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women's 15km individual biathlon at these winter olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the same day, the international winter biathlon union decided to ban her from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> it has been a consistent rule of the international olympic committee that any athlete found to have used performance-enhancing drugs at an olympics games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation, but will receive no legal penalty. </seg>
<seg id="9"> but under italian law, athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants. judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance-enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> in december last year, after one year of "bargaining", the international olympic committee and the italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this winter olympics in accordance with italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> following unremitting efforts by the international olympic committee, italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the winter olympics to a promise that police would not enter the olympic village to search athletes' dwellings during the winter olympic games. but athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> reports say that pescante, the italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics, had referred the pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in turin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> but neither the international olympic committee nor pescante himself has yet confirmed the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that pyleva had left turin to return to her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> shi kangcheng, a chinese sports official who worked for years in the world anti-doping agency, said that once pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled. </seg>
<seg id="16"> shi kangcheng added that the international olympic committee and the italian government had never been "thorough" in their anti-doping drive at the winter olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if italian prosecutors did step in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> based on past instances of punishment handed down to italian athletes that have used performance-enhancing drugs, the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than "two years of prison term served on probation". </seg>
<seg id="18"> for this reason, senior reporter of italy's ansa [pei ai]predicted that the possibility of pyleva going to prison was "exceedingly slim" and that a fine would be the most she would receive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> also said  that although an italian court can pass judgment in absentia, it would be impossible for the italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term. </seg>
<seg id="20"> if pyleva refused to accept a judgment, there would be no way italian authorities could detain her. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (selected best of newspapers and periodicals) shanghai: persons with concurrent jobs and graduates of institutions of higher education become main force of hourly wage earners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news february 7 from beijing. shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security announced its 'guide to minimum hourly wages for 2006' on february 6.  the number of jobs covered reached 120, 11 more than last time.  wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> according to the estimations of relevant experts at the shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security, shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to a report in "china youth magazine," graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs (holding two or more jobs at once) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs, it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs.  the proportion of this group reaches 51.1% of the whole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> the level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high, they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures, such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7%, and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> a high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> according to our understanding, some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of rmb, such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation.  the majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 rmb or more, such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs, wedding masters of ceremonies, and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> satisfying personal interests and expanding one's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages. </seg>
<seg id="10"> for example, mr. gu, who holds the position of manager of the human resources department of a certain enterprise, will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business. </seg>
<seg id="11"> mr. gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates, and he has opportunities to be involved in another area.  of course, a monthly income of 2000 rmb also has a certain attraction. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news february 9 from beijing, (reporter li xing).  to increase the international competitiveness of china, greatly further maintainable development, and realize key development leaps, the "national mid to long term science and technology development plan guidelines (2006-2020)" released by the state council on february 9 deploys four key science research plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> these four key science research plans are protein research, particle control research, nano research, and growth and procreation research. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> chinese expert: america beating drum of 'chinese military threat' is irrational criticism </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua new february 9 from beijing (reporters li xuanliang, xiong zhengyan, and lin liping)  the pentagon's "quadrennial defense review report" formally handed over to congress in recent days has for the first time referred to china as 'the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to america'. </seg>
<seg id="3"> experts believe this is an irrational criticism of china's normal defense construction, a dramatization of the 'chinese military threat theory', and is an interference in china's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> the "quadrennial defense review report" is the pentagon's new national defense policy paper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of chinese military force and what paths america should take to meet this problem.  the report directly brings up 'china' or 'chinese' a total of 15 times, saying 'as a major and newly prosperous large nation, china has the most potential to carry out military competition with america.  if america does not have counter-measures, china will likely develop destructive military technologies, thus breaking america's advantage in conventional weapons.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> researcher yao yunzhu of the world military research department of the china military science institute says that, although high level american officials have expressed similar views many times before, this is the first time america put forward that 'china is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to america' in its 'defense strategy reports'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> 'this report for the first time clearly takes russia, india, and china as newly rising strategic opponents, among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called chinese military threat theory.' </seg>
<seg id="8"> said major general peng guangqian, researcher of the china military science institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> worth noting is that on the same day that the "quadrennial defense review report" was formally handed in, american president bush also handed to congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007, in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion usd. </seg>
<seg id="10"> 'if you add on to this the budget for the military movements in iraq and afghanistan, america's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion usd, setting a new historic high' peng guangqian said. 'this is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> peng guangqian believes that the method of america concocting 'threat theories from other countries' reflects the pentagon's usual style of 'creating enemies.'  its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures, and dredging up even more profits for america's huge military industrial complex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> experts say, compared with america's huge military expenditures, china's defense expenditures are relatively limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> military expert deng hongzhou, who has taken part in the writing of china's defense white paper several times, said that since the 1990's, along with economic development, china's defense expenditures have increased, but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979, china's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
<seg id="15"> in 2005, china's defense expenditures were 244.656 billion rmb, equal to only approximately 1/14 of america's.  average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1/60 of america's.  per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1/30 of america's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> 'america's land area is about equal to china's land area, but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference.  it is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs.' </seg>
<seg id="17"> peng guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> teng jianqun, director of the research department of china's military control and disarmament association, expressed that america should objectively appraise the situation of china's military construction. china's peaceful development does not mean that china and america will become military opponents in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the "china's defense in 2004" white paper said china staunchly follows the path of peaceful development, and carries out a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> china has never become a threat to any country in the past or present, and will not become a threat in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> up until now, china has not established military bases in any country, and has not sent one soldier to any other country, while america has over 100 military bases abroad, and in the asian pacific region alone has in excess of 100,000 military forces deployed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> professor zhu feng of beijing university's international relations institute said that china and america should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges, increase understanding and mutual trust, comprehensively further chinese and american constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development. </seg>

<seg id="2"> xinhua news february 9 from ramallah (internationl observation). hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> xinhua news reporter hao huangmin </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> after the palestine islamic resistance movement (hamas) obtained victory in legislative elections, how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="5"> what kinds of new policies hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at the same time, the attitude of resistance of america and israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> at present, various palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation, and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (sub heading) who will the position of premier fall to? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, there have been people in the outside world who worry a 'hamas premier' will likely see differently than the current high leader abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> also, hamas leader mashal, who is currently visiting egypt, emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel.  this intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="11"> america and israel explicitly state they will not accept a hamas government that controls real power, and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> however, this has not obstructed hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> according to reports, to acquire international approval across the largest range possible, earlier domestic and foreign hamas leaders meeting together in egypt decided to choose independent ismail haniyeh, chairman of the board of trustees of the islamic university in gaza, to be appointed the new premier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> this move has still not received the responses of concerned parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> palestine analyst hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to, what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the 'hard' aspects of hamas as much as possible.  only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (sub heading) how to allocate power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> looking at the internal makeup of the party, the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the palestine "daily" published an analysis saying that while hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects, in the area of being in power it lacks experience.  hamas cooperating with the palestinian national liberation movement (fatah), which has experience being in power, would be the best strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner' relationship with fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government, however fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present. </seg>
<seg id="20"> opinions among those in the fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same.  one faction advocates participating in the new government, and thus having something to say; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas, and would rather be an 'active opposition faction' in the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="21"> persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of abbas, fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> although this might be the case, hamas and fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> besides this, another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="24"> according to reports, hamas has also designed a technocracy government, but the concrete list of names is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> in light of the attitude of israel and america, a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to regulations of the palestine "basic law," after the new legislature convenes on the february 16, the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (sub heading) at a loss about armed forces </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news february 10 from beijing (reporter li jianmin).  china's state oceanic administration released the "2005 china polar region survey report" in recent days.  this is the first time china has released this kind of report in the over 20 years since china opened polar region scientific survey activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> the "report" fully reflects china's polar region scientific survey activities for 2005, the safeguarding of logistics for polar region surveys, the main developments and results in polar region scientific research and other situations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to that recorded in the "report," on january 9, 2005, at 10:15 p.m. (beijing time), china's polar region survey's inland ice sheet survey team reached an ice dome with the highest altitude on the antarctica shelf - region a; on january 18 at 3:15 a.m. (beijing time) they confirmed that the highest point on ice dome a was 4093 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> 'on the stage of the daily intensifying competition of international polar region surveys, china relied on its will of iron and unshakable spirit to bravely open up a brand new region, and opened up an assault on the highest point on the antarctic ice sheet for the first time, obtaining success in the first attempt and realizing another dream of mankind in antarctica.' </seg>
<seg id="6"> sun zhihui, head of the state oceanic administration said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> the "report" shows that on march 24, 2005, china's 21st antarctic survey team successfully completed their task and returned to shanghai.  their tour of research lasted 151 days, a voyage of 26,500 knots. </seg>
<seg id="8"> on november 18 of the same year, china's 22nd antarctic survey team left shanghai, going to zhongshan station in antarctica to carry out scientific investigation activities, and will leave zhongshan station at the end of february 2006 to return to shanghai via australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> because this is the first time china has released its polar region survey report, the "2005 china polar region survey report" also carried out a review and summary of chinese polar region surveys beginning in the early 1980's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> according to the "report", in 1983 china formally entered the "antarctica treaty", became a member country of the antarctica treaty system, and also became a negotiating country in the antarctica treaty, a member of the antarctica science research committee, a member of the antarctica council, and other influential international organizations dealing with antarctica. </seg>
<seg id="11"> in 1997, china became a member of the arctic science committee, winning the right to decide policy and speak in international polar region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> the "report" points out that in over 20 years, china's polar region surveys have "continuously developed from nothing and for the first time have real scope."  the antarctic and arctic science survey system already has "three stations and one ship," that is: changcheng station established in february 1985 in antarctica, zhongshan station established in february 1989 in antarctica, huanghe station established in july 2004 in the arctic, and the "xuelong" class polar survey ship that began to undertake survey missions to the arctic in 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> the "report" estimates that as of the end of 2005, china had already organized 22 antarctic science surveys, two arctic science surveys using the "xuelong" as a platform, and two survey's from the huanghe arctic station.  as of the present, china already has sent over 3000 people to personally go to the antarctic or the arctic to carry out on-sight surveys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "at present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third antarctic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for china." </seg>
<seg id="15"> sun zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "after over 20 years of hard work, china's polar region survey enterprise already has a definite position among the world's polar region surveys.  however, compared with the other main polar region surveying countries, there still exists a relatively large discrepancy.  we must push on ahead." </seg>

<seg id="4"> the 'artificial kidney unit' and the 'artificial urine tubes' are both made up of hollow fibers.  the inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material. </seg>

<seg id="6"> artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste, and could not totally get rid of everything.  they also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood. </seg>

<seg id="2"> xinhua news february 13 from beijing (reporter an bei).  an official of the state electricity supervision committee said on february 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend, the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> shi yubo, chairman of the state electricity supervision committee, said at the 5th (expanded) state electricity safe production committee conference being held in beijing that china's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend.  it satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer peaks, realized the safe supplying of energy, actively responded to the attack of natural disasters, and basically assured the safe and stable operations of the electricity system.  safe electricity production facility accidents and normal electricity grid accidents saw a large decrease over that of last year, and the health level of electricity facilities received enhancement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> however, he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups, safe electricity production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> these challenges include the continued existence of regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight.   the supply of electricity coal (coal used in generating electricity) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism.  at the same time, the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls, seriously influencing the stable operations of generator groups.  the structure of some electricity grids are weak, facilities are old and bring hidden problems to system safety.  the situation of common electricity infrastructure accidents has still not received a fundamental turn around, and the trend is still grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> shi yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system, many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed.  the new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce, and secure a normal production order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> in terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006, shi yubo expressed that we must further solidify the basic tasks of safe electricity production management, speed up the establishment and perfection of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms, and increase the ability to handle unexpected incidents.  in addition, we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant grid and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system.  we must also continue to do the tasks of supervision management and informational construction for large dam hydro electric plants, assure the safety of large dams, strengthen safety management of electricity construction, and decrease the occurrence of injuries or deaths from accidents.  finally, we must continue to strengthen information reporting tasks and ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and free flow of electricity safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> according to our understanding, by uniting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modifications and perfections of the already published "temporary investigation regulations on electricity production accidents" this year, while the relevant accompanying documents on large hydro electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="10"> facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non-advantageous situations, various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management.  last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation's electricity production. </seg>

<seg id="4"> although italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the turin olympics would likely face "the specter of jail;" however, looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this winter olympics, russian biathlon athlete olga pyleva, will not likely face jail-time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the turin olympic committee revealed the first stimulant scandal of the games on february 16.  it was discovered that olga pyleva used the prohibited stimulant carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the next day, the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had already been expelled from the winter olympics, and the gold medal she won in the women's biathlon 15 km individual race at this winter olympics had already been stripped from her. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the international biathlon union passed a punitive decision to ban pyleva from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> it has always been that the international olympic committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the olympic games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away, but they would not receive the punishment of the law. </seg>
<seg id="9"> however, according to italian law, athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates.  those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> last december, the international olympic committee and the italian government concluded "negotiations" that had lasted as long as a year, finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to italian law at this winter olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> after the tireless efforts of the international olympic committee, italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the winter olympics, promising that during the winter olympics police would not enter the olympic village and search the residences of athletes.  however, athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by italian authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> reports state that mario pescante, the official supervising the turin olympics for the italian government, has already handed over the pyleva stimulant incident to turin investigating authorities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, the international olympic committee and pescante have not confirmed this as of present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> russian team doctor for the biathlon team andrey dmytriev revealed on february 17 that pyleva had already left turin and returned to russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> chinese sports official shi liancheng, who worked for many years at the world anti-stimulant organization, believes that as soon as pyleva returns to russia, this incident's ending will likely be "inconclusive." </seg>
<seg id="16"> shi liancheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant problems at the winter olympics, and although the italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play, the results are hard to predict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in italy, the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than "two years of suspended imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> therefore, senior reporter pieri of italy's ansa news expressed that the likelihood of pyleva going to prison is "extremely small," and at most a fine will be given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> pieri expressed that although italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present, italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring pyleva back for punishment. </seg>

<seg id="1"> let's again direct our attention to the iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> the international atomic energy agency confirmed on the 6th that the iranian government has written a letter to the iaea requesting for the removal of all the equipment monitoring iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> due to the iaea decision to report the iran nuclear issue to the un security council, iran has announced the termination of all its support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the iaea to conduct snap inspection of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> in response to the current tensions concerning the iran nuclear issue, russian foreign minister lavrov said in athens, greece, that the cooperation between russia and iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this will become the motivation for the resolution to the iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> a russian foreign ministry spokesperson said that day that russia's proposal to iran for establishing a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in russia still stands. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the two sides may conduct negotiations on this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> on the same day, lugar, chairman of the us senate foreign relations committee, said at the un headquarters in new york that the us does not endorse israeli attacks on iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> some recent news report said that israeli defense experts said that the israeli air force may deal serious blows to iran's nuclear facilities if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> according to xinhua news agency, russian deputy foreign minister kislyak said on the 7th that russia is willing to cooperate with iran on the nuclear issue so as to help iran obtain the legal right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> kislyak said that russia's proposal for a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with iran is still valid now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> russia hopes to have negotiations with iran on this issue in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13"> at the end of december last year, russia submitted a proposal to iran regarding the establishment of a joint uranium enrichment enterprise by the two countries in russia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> both the eu and the us indicated that they can accept this plan for a compromise. </seg>
<seg id="15"> however, iran hopes that russia can continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> chinese foreign ministry spokesman kong quan said on the 7th that though the iaea reported the iran nuclear issue to the un security council, it did not hand over the agency's responsibility for handling the iran nuclear issue to the security council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> therefore, all parties still need to break the deadlock on the iran nuclear issue within the iaea framework. </seg>
<seg id="18"> according to the iaea resolution, iaea director general elbaradei will submit a report on the iran nuclear issue to the security council in march. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the security council will make a final decision after evaluating this report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> we think this resolution is asking iran to fulfill the relevant security council resolution and its commitments without submitting or referring the issue to the security council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> recently, china has been seeking a peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear issue through diplomatic channels. </seg>
<seg id="22"> kong quan said that on february 1, zhang yan, director-general of arms control and disarmament department of china's foreign ministry, and larijani, secretary of iran's supreme national security council and chief nuclear negotiator, held talks on the iran nuclear issue in tehran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> the chinese side hopes that iran should pay attention to the key issue of the international community and create conditions for peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> solving the iran nuclear issue within the iaea framework not only conforms to the interests of the chinese side but also, as we believe firmly, conforms to the interests of all parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> for that purpose, we also call upon all relevant parties in the international community again not to abandon diplomatic efforts for this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> hamas, which is currently forming a new palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that except for the candidate for prime minister, the name list of the new government's cabinet has been basically finalized. </seg>
<seg id="2"> this led outsiders to have a variety of speculations on the candidate for prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> a senior hamas official disclosed to the associated press on the 8th that hamas is preparing to nominate al-khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the islamic university in gaza, as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but this nomination has not been officially submitted to abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> backed by hamas, 50-year-old al-khudairi participated in the election of the palestinian legislative council as an independent candidate last month. </seg>
<seg id="5"> al-khudairi never mentioned violence or anything against israel in his public speech. </seg>
<seg id="6"> however, he said that palestine needs internal reforms. </seg>
<seg id="7"> currently, a senior hamas delegation is visiting cairo and discussing with egypt on the issue of hamas forming a new palestinian government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> khalid mashal, one of the delegates, told the news media on the 8th that in spite of the pressure that has kept coming from the international community and some arab countries, the palestinian government formed by the leadership of hamas will not recognize israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> at the same time, mashal also warned abbas in his speech not to willfully change the structure of the palestinian leadership without prior consultation with hamas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> analysts consider this a response to abbas's plan to appoint interior minister yusuf as deputy commander of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, regarding the issue of forming a new palestinian autonomous government, mashal refused to confirm the news that hamas is preparing to nominate al-khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the islamic university in gaza, to serve as prime minister of the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> mashal said that the candidate for prime minister has not been finalized. </seg>
<seg id="13"> prior to mashal's reiteration of refusing to recognize israel, marzouk, another hamas political leader, said in an interview with egyptian tv that hamas will absolutely not recognize the legitimate status of israel, but the new government will continue to keep contact with israel in various areas, because recognizing israel or not is a totally different thing from whether to have contact with it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> apart from the fresh or old hatred of the three hamas prime minister candidates against israel, the issue of the territory has also been a tough question concerning palestinian-israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> israeli acting prime minister olmert said in an interview with israel tv channel 2 on the 7th that israel must separate from palestine by setting permanent borders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> this means that israel will have to withdraw from part of its territories in the west bank. </seg>
<seg id="17"> however, olmert stressed that israel will continue to control major jewish settlements in the west bank and jordan valley area and maintain the integrity of jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="1"> let's look at a few japan-related news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> er, koizumi has always wanted to upgrade japan's defense agency to a ministry, so as to increase japan's military strength. </seg>
<seg id="3"> however, along the way, this process has aroused a lot of controversy and undergone many twists and turns. </seg>
<seg id="4"> recently, some project bid-rigging scandals broke out in the defense facilities administration agency under japan's defense agency, causing some current and former officials to be arrested by authorities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> as a result, quite a few people advised koizumi to be careful about upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> well, recently koizumi said that he would shelve this plan and would not submit it to the diet for review for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="7"> well, he also hopes the two governing parties can carefully discuss this issue and continue, er, consultations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> on another note, if you go to japan, there is now a new regulation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> that is, japan plans, stipulates that most tourists and travelers to japan must have their fingerprints scanned and photographs taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> this is a way of preventing some dangerous people from entering japanese territory, and in addition, of guarding against illegal immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> er, so, going to japan should now be even more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="12"> well, of course, recently there has also been a piece of good news in japan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> that is, princess kiko, wife of japan's prince akishinomiya, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the event makes many japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> however, she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful imperial household. </seg>
<seg id="16"> er, in fact kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman.  moreover, people have always thought she was satisfied with a four-member family. </seg>
<seg id="17"> to be pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help speculating that er, this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the imperial household. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of course, this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people. </seg>
<seg id="19"> it is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> er, it is like this.  when the wife of crown prince naruhito suffered from depression in 2002, the imperial household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on prince fumihito. </seg>
<seg id="21"> at that time, fumihito did not respond much to this. </seg>
<seg id="22"> but by 2004, the conflict had become somewhat intense, because naruhito, eager to protect his wife, criticized the imperial household in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> well, it is said that the imperial household at that time was furious and asked prince fumihito, who is of the same generation, to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the imperial household while spoiling his own wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> the two brothers have not been on good terms since. </seg>
<seg id="25"> well, now if a boy is born to prince fumihito, then they, as core members, will become a pillar of the imperial household. </seg>
<seg id="26"> meanwhile, the eastern palace, that is, the elder prince, would surely decline as a result. </seg>
<seg id="27"> er, so, quite a number of people think that if this is the case, it will have a great impact on the imperial household and japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="22"> well, since iran and the us are making no concession to each other in their positions, recently there have also been some format changes.  that is, iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume their uranium enrichment programs. </seg>

<seg id="24"> in addition, iran also announced that it would postpone its talks with russia indefinitely.  that is, the talks on russia refining uranium for iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> well, of course, the indefinite postponement of the talks was also decided based on this new situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> well, recently, since the us continues to threaten iran with attacks, the oxford research institute, a uk think tank, issued this report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> if the us really wants to use force, then half of the people will be dead because of that.  in addition, it will of course trigger, um, may keep this year's wave of violence in the middle east going on. </seg>

<seg id="29"> of course, oil prices will also soar, which is also one of the series of domino effects. </seg>

<seg id="3"> well, this editorial specifically mentioned that japanese foreign minister taro aso recently made a string of appalling remarks. </seg>
<seg id="4"> these remarks were all very dishonest and very unwise.  furthermore, the remarks have triggered widespread indignation among asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> well, this editorial also specifically mentioned that japan should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lesson rather than avoid mentioning in post-ww ii textbooks some of their deeds during the war as they are doing right now. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at the same time, the editorial also said that many of taro aso's current remarks, for instance, requesting the prime minister to visit yasukuni shrine, for instance, saying taiwanese colonial rule raised, um, ah, the japanese colonial rule raised taiwan's educational level, and so on, it said such remarks were all very appalling.  moreover, it is evident that he has no knowledge of history and is a very poor diplomat too. </seg>
<seg id="7"> since the new york times was the third largest newspaper in circulation in the united states last year, it should be very influential in the us society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> as a result, such an editorial should also be very influential. </seg>
<seg id="9"> in the meantime, some former senior us government officials and some us experts on asian issues, they recently held a special forum, that is, a forum on sino-japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> well, at this forum, some experts put forward this viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="11"> it said that as current sino-japanese relations are under great tensions, there may be potential danger of military conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> furthermore, it even said that now there is a greater possibility of a military conflict breaking out between china and japan than between china and taiwan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> er, moreover, once the military conflict breaks out, it will surely drag the us into it because the us will surely get involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> well, a japanese foreign ministry spokesperson also participating in the forum said that sino-japanese relations are now indeed under great tensions. </seg>
<seg id="15"> so, any mistake will lead to serious consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> on another note, the georgian parliament's defense and security committee held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the russian peacekeeping force from south ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="17"> the russian parliament will hold a general assembly to review this bill today. </seg>
<seg id="18"> er, experts think that if the parliament agrees to expel the russian peacekeeping force, it may lead to the complete breakup of georgian-russian ties. </seg>
<seg id="19"> a spokesperson for the russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two of the russian peacekeeping contingent's military vehicles transporting foods were intercepted by georgian police with the driver expelled. </seg>
<seg id="20"> er, the spokesperson called for georgia to stop immediately such provocations; otherwise russia would assume no responsibility for the consequences of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> two military vehicles belonging to the logistic system of the russian peacekeeping contingent transporting foods and groceries were examined by georgian police monday night in georgia's south ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> georgian law enforcement personnel on duty expelled the russian driver and escorting personnel and forcibly drove away the two military vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="23"> the incident greatly angered the russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> a spokesperson for the russian peacekeeping force said that on february 1, georgian police detained a russian military vehicle in the area on an excuse of a traffic accident and has not returned it so far. </seg>
<seg id="25"> on february 8, three russian military officers were detained for two days and nights on grounds of visa problems. </seg>
<seg id="26"> georgia's reckless provocations were aimed to incur bloodshed in the area by forcing the russian troops to open fire so that it could achieve the goal of the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from south ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="27"> on that day, the russian embassy in georgia made serious representations to the georgian side, demanding georgia to immediately stop frenzied provocations; otherwise the russian side will not assume any consequence of the resulting conflict. </seg>
<seg id="28"> the media noted that on february 13, georgian defense minister okruashvili announced that the head of the russian military base in akhalkalaki sold several strela portable air defense missile systems to south ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="29"> on that day, the georgian parliament defense and security committee held an expanded meeting to hear a report by the law enforcement agency.  it decided to expel the russian peacekeeping troops in georgia and called for a review of this issue at the general assembly on the 14th. </seg>
<seg id="30"> experts think that the final decision, once passed, may eventually lead to the complete breakup of georgian-russian ties. </seg>
<seg id="31"> earlier, georgian foreign minister bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the russian position and refuted russian president putin's remark that russia may recognize abkhazia and south ossetia should the west recognize kosovo.  he thinks that russian authorities are sending an encouraging signal to all secessionist districts. </seg>
<seg id="32"> the russian foreign ministry also announced earlier that it would protect russian citizens in south ossetia, implying a direct threat of military force to georgia. </seg>

<seg id="8"> since the us military also expressed hope for more transparency in china's pla operations while inviting china to participate in the military exercise, some defense experts think that this shows the pentagon's hope to sound each other out through the joint military exercise because it is not sure about the purpose of china's military expansion. </seg>
<seg id="9"> in addition, since the defense review report released by the pentagon at the beginning of this month considered china the greatest potential threat, the two defense experts also pointed out that the asia-pacific military exercise is the first step that the us department of defense takes to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>

<seg id="1"> let's look at a few japan-related news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> recently there has been a rather shocking piece of news in japanese political circles. </seg>
<seg id="3"> that is, tsuneo watanabe, chairman of the yomiuri shimbun, the number one in the japanese media, he ordered the yomiuri shimbun to publish some articles against koizumi's visit to yasukuni shrine.  furthermore, the yomiuri shimbun has since taken a position against koizumi's visit to yasukuni shrine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> er, well, um, tsuneo watanabe, he was lashing out against koizumi in his speech a few days ago, saying he is very ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture. </seg>
<seg id="5"> at the same time he also said that visiting yasukuni shrine is like singing praises of hitler.  in addition, he said that by doing so, koizumi also made china and south korea consider japan a very dangerous country.  this is going to have no end of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="6"> well, why could tsuneo watanabe, his attitude trigger great impact? </seg>
<seg id="7"> actually, he is also very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along. </seg>
<seg id="8"> yet, he used to be a very rightist figure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> we should say he had always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment. </seg>
<seg id="10"> but now, ah, this is really a big turn. </seg>
<seg id="11"> he now directed his attacks against koizumi and started to oppose such a stance. </seg>
<seg id="12"> actually in 2004 when someone attacked koizumi for visiting yasukuni shrine, um, tsuneo watanabe, he still said, he said, er, he supported him and wanted koizumi to resist the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, he gave a speech recently.  he said, i am already more than 80 years old and don't have much time left. </seg>
<seg id="14"> well, he has now adopted a high-sounding tone and taken on a kind of highly anti-war stance in his speech. </seg>
<seg id="15"> this kind of changing sides by him, of course, has a great social impact in japan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> just like tsuneo watanabe said himself, he said, i firmly believe i have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> furthermore, he also said that should the yomiuri shimbun's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure, he would resist it at the risk of his life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> well, what kind of situation has it come to now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> that is, the yomiuri shimbun, the largest newspaper in japan, and the asahi shimbun, the second largest newspaper in japan, now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing koizumi's visit to yasukuni shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> originally, these two large newspapers were opponents, but later when the two chairmen met, they at least reached consensus on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="21"> as a result, they now both launched massive attacks on koizumi, forming what we could call a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> actually, these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on japanese mainstream public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in addition, let's look at the meeting of japan's house of representatives.  at one of their recent meetings, two relatively popular candidates for successor to japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi made the same remark. </seg>
<seg id="24"> who are these two people? </seg>
<seg id="25"> one is chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe, and the other is japanese foreign minister taro aso, who has made a series of appalling remarks recently. </seg>
<seg id="26"> what remarks did these two make? </seg>
<seg id="27"> they said that japan's wwii criminals were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> what they meant was, er, it was the international court that has called them criminals and convicted them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> whereas, in japan, according to the international law, they were; according to the domestic law in japan, er, the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of japan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> therefore, they think that wwii criminals should not be considered criminals in japan. </seg>
<seg id="31"> at the same time, um, shinzo abe, he also mentioned that japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the united states and develop commercial and trade relations with, um, some east asian countries.  in addition, it should also try its best to develop close ties with india.  it should not always focus on china. </seg>

<seg id="1"> championship hopeful but not assured </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> love life, love luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> the fire will soon be lit on the battlefield of the chinese super league. </seg>
<seg id="4"> luneng taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the fight for the championship among dalian, shandong, and shanghai is on the verge of breaking out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> who will win the championship in the end? </seg>
<seg id="7"> based on an analysis of strength, although the taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship, it is not 100 percent assured. </seg>
<seg id="8"> first, new team members have little time to get adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the taishan team had four major openings last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> this year, following recruitment of the two famous national football players li leilei and wang liang, the taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players.  its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, since the national team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq, there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates. </seg>
<seg id="12"> by the time they return to the team, the super league will be starting. </seg>
<seg id="13"> therefore, the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the taishan team now faces. </seg>
<seg id="14"> in my opinion, the national football players can serve as substitutes in the first few super league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> first, the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="16"> second, it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> after sharpening their skills in several matches, it will not be too late to enter the battle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the next problem is the hidden troubles on defense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> last year, the taishan team's defense was criticized by football fans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> this year, defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of li leilei, but it's not yet time to rest easy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the central back still has a problem with turning around slowly, while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if the central back can put forth a stable performance this year, then the taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> i think it may be a good idea to use ren yongshun, who is in good physical shape.  despite insufficient experience, he can test himself this year and prepare for the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in addition, it is also fine to recall gao yao to play sweeper. </seg>
<seg id="25"> there are quite a few members of the taishan team who can play defensive midfield.  both cui peng and haibin can play. </seg>
<seg id="26"> gao yao, who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball, should be able to do a good job as central back. </seg>
<seg id="27"> also, whether the foreign players can adjust themselves... </seg>
<seg id="28"> issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the taishan team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> last year, danciulescu's performance left much to be desired. </seg>
<seg id="30"> i know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet. </seg>
<seg id="31"> i think that this year, in addition to recruiting an excellent striker, a pure left midfielder should be recruited. </seg>
<seg id="32"> except for xing rui a few years ago, the taishan team has not had a single true left-footed specialist. </seg>
<seg id="33"> although cui peng and others are all competent, however, a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand-in. </seg>
<seg id="34"> if these three problems can be resolved well, the road to the championship for the taishan team should be a bit smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> as a shandong football fan, i hope very much that the taishan team will win the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> however, to be honest, based on this year's competitive situation, the taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances. </seg>

<seg id="11"> that is mr. li mingshun, general manager of discuz beijing company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> if you search for his name on google, you can get a lot of hits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> i roughly know that he used to be at sina and later started his own business, an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium-sized businesses, similar to adbrite.com abroad. </seg>
<seg id="14"> at that time he debated on msn to the effect that vista thinks that the development of many sectors in china all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium-sized businesses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> however, the situation in this respect in china's markets now is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="16"> therefore, the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium-sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale. </seg>
<seg id="17"> charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> later he came to discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> discuz is an excellent community software based on php and mysql database. </seg>
<seg id="20"> with the help of ramboo, a technical engineer in beijing, the brandvista community finally saw hope again and emerged with a brand-new look. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the feedback is excellent. </seg>

<seg id="30"> after losing several heavyweight clients in a row and suffering a series of setbacks in its development in mainland china, sir martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in italy to think about reshuffling his cards. </seg>
<seg id="31"> batey advertising, batey will merge with the jwt network while keeping its brand name under the jwt management. </seg>

<seg id="3"> i saw this article and want to share it with you. </seg>
<seg id="4"> this is not out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> i asked myself how i would act if it were me. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the answer was very clear.  i would put down the phone with a "you dialed a wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> i have been thinking this year what exactly can be considered helping others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> i have already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations. </seg>
<seg id="9"> two days ago, a friend said, i have already no time to take care of myself.  even if i want to help others, i will not have the energy to do it. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wish you a pleasant day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> mom ten years ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> on that day ten years ago, when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break, the telephone rang suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="14"> she picked up the phone and listened, yet out came a strange rough voice: "we have caught your kid stealing a book.  come here quick!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> coming from the other end of the line was a little girl's crying锛along with loud scolding voices of others. </seg>
<seg id="16"> glancing over at her only daughter, who was watching tv nearby, it suddenly dawned upon her. </seg>
<seg id="17"> obviously, a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book.  as she did not want to let her family know it, she must have made up a phone number at random.  that was how they happened to call here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call.  she could also even reprimand the other party, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this incident had nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> however, being a teacher, she thought she might be her own student. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl, who made the momentary slip, must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> hesitating for a moment, an idea suddenly occurred to her.  right, just do it this way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> so, after making sure about the bookstore's address, she hurried there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> just as she expected, a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore, </seg>
<seg id="25"> while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof. </seg>
<seg id="26"> she rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms.  turning around, she said to the sales person nearby: "talk to me.  don't scare the kid." </seg>
<seg id="27"> amid the sales person's reluctant mutterings, she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear-smudged, terrified face. </seg>
<seg id="28"> she laughed and took the little girl home.  she gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything. </seg>
<seg id="29"> before she took off, she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly, if you want to read books, just come to the auntie's place.  there are many books inside. </seg>
<seg id="30"> the little girl, who had still not yet recovered from her horror, took a close look at her and scampered away.  she never reappeared. </seg>
<seg id="31"> time went by like a rushing stream.  ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> having long forgotten this thing, she still lived here, leading a quiet and peaceful life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> one day at noon, there was a series of knocks on the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> when she opened the door, she saw a stranger, a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked doubtfully. </seg>
<seg id="37"> in her excitement, that girl said a great deal. </seg>
<seg id="38"> only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl, a stranger to her, did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year.  she had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> with her eyes glistening with tears, the young girl said softly: "though i have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out, i have always felt all these ten years that i want to call you mom." </seg>
<seg id="40"> the teacher's eyes also grew blurry. </seg>
<seg id="41"> she asked curiously: "if i had not helped you, what would have happened?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> the girl's face immediately darkened.  she gently shook her head and said: "i am not sure.  i could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide." </seg>
<seg id="43"> the teacher's heart trembled, and she started to feel rejoiced secretly. </seg>
<seg id="44"> the decision she made on the spur of the moment that year turned out to have had such an impact on one person's life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> looking at the happy smile on the girl's face, she also smiled. </seg>

<seg id="1"> observation on military situation: how long would iran be able to hold on against us military air strikes? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> if we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death, then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy's head at the outset, turning it into a "vegetable" with no time to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the difference between iran and the us in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> iran, which fought an eight-year war with iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the british international intelligence review recently mentioned, after analyzing us military deployments, that us troops are preparing to launch a large-scale air strike on iran... </seg>
<seg id="7"> the current status of the iranian air force is rather worrisome. </seg>
<seg id="8"> the current status of the iranian air force is very similar to the pre-war iraqi air force in 2003. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently and is also under the arms embargo imposed by the west. </seg>
<seg id="10"> upon the breakout of war, it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the iranian air force could take off and fight the us military. </seg>
<seg id="11"> currently, iran's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land-based air defense force of iran's regular military as well as the air defense force of the revolutionary guard corps. </seg>
<seg id="12"> among these, the iranian air force is currently about 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models. </seg>
<seg id="13"> the main plane models are us-made f-4 phantoms, f-5 tigers, and f-14 tomcats, and russian-made mig-29s, among others. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the land-based air defense forces are mainly equipped with us-made hawk, british-made arrow, and some russian-made sam series surface-to-air missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> analyzing the current status of the iranian air defense forces, harold hutchinson, a us military expert, khramchikhin, a military expert at russia's institute of political and military analysis, and others think that looking at the current situation, there are still some holes in iran's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power, the iranian air force is absolutely not at the same level as the us military. </seg>
<seg id="17"> the large number of us-made fighter planes iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts, upgrades, and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of the f-14 fighters, once considered the trump of the iranian air force, currently only 10-plus can take off. </seg>
<seg id="19"> it is also questionable whether the aim-54 phoenix missiles that they carry, which are said to have over-the-horizon attack capability, are reliable in actual battle. </seg>
<seg id="20"> khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the us provided to iran in the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> some other non-system air defense weapons acquired from russia and other countries are no match for the us military, which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures. </seg>
<seg id="22"> scraping it together has an effect on combat power. </seg>
<seg id="23"> the iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies.  in a last-minute effort to update its weaponry, it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> from what can be seen at present, its methods can be summarized into two. </seg>
<seg id="25"> first, work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to a report by the british newspaper the times, iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the natanz nuclear plant and isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2-meter thick cement protection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> however, the us military is a step ahead, having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 gulf war in defending against air strikes, it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> after more than ten years of targeted research, the us military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> since the end of last year, the iranian government has made successive agreements with russia to purchase the pechora-2a air defense missile system, along with 29 sets of the tor-m1 air defense missile system worth 700 million us dollars. </seg>
<seg id="31"> however, modern warfare is a competition between systems. </seg>
<seg id="32"> the various air strike weapons of the us military were all developed independently by their own country.  furthermore, after years of real war experience, they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines. </seg>
<seg id="33"> in contrast, whether the "new weapons" iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue. </seg>
<seg id="34"> iran is not lagging behind in weapons only. </seg>
<seg id="35"> the army field manual published by the us military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of "air land battle," which emphasizes attacking the enemy's deeply strategic and high-value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than "meat on the chopping board" no matter how powerful its regular military strength. </seg>
<seg id="36"> in the 1991 gulf war, the 1999 kosovo war, and the 2003 iraq war, the us military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> although the iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities, iran, which fought an eight-year war with iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> along with the us military's progress in recent years in military transformation work, the us military's air strike operations already completely differ from vietnam war era carpet bombing, depending instead on various kinds of high-tech weapons and on modern information technology-based high precision and full depth air attacks. </seg>
<seg id="39"> confronted with such air strikes, it is still unknown how long iran's land-based air defense system would be able to hold on. </seg>

<seg id="1"> joining hands with google in battling microsoft, dell charges software vendors "shelving fees?" </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> yun feiquan </seg>

<seg id="3"> dell inc. (us: dell) and google confirmed on tuesday that dell is testing personal computers that have installed google pack. </seg>
<seg id="4"> this move may pose a severe threat against microsoft's (msft) dominant position in the pc software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> dell press spokesman jess blackburn indicated that the company is evaluating google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> after installing this software, pc users can use the software to search the web as well as search for information stored on the pc. </seg>
<seg id="7"> blackburn confirmed that at this time, the software being tested by the company include a google-supported dell homepage, google desktop search, and google toolbar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> at the same time, google press spokesman jon murchinson also confirmed that his company and dell were testing a bundle of software developed by google. </seg>
<seg id="9"> earlier, the wall street journal reported that it upstart google was in the process of negotiations with dell and hewlett-packard co., among others, in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include google software in their pcs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> according to insider sources quoted by the wall street journal, google may pay up to 1 billion us dollars to dell over the next three years to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, the two companies did not reveal any of the relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> in addition, hewlett packard refused to comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> microsoft press spokesman neil charney refused to comment on the above news. </seg>
<seg id="14"> as of now, microsoft is planning to release its next-generation windows operating system search tool and boost its development of web services. </seg>
<seg id="15"> on the day the news was released, google's stock price again dropped by 4.46% to 367.92 us dollars. </seg>
<seg id="16"> microsoft's stock price fell this day by 1%, closing at 26.94 us dollars. </seg>
<seg id="17"> some analysts pointed out that google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search.  joining hands with pc giants such as dell may cause google to threaten microsoft's core business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> matt rosoff, an analyst from market research firm directions on microsoft, indicated that google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources, which is definitely something microsoft is concerned about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> however, some analysts are rather unimpressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> charles di bona, an analyst from market analysis firm sanford c. bernstein, pointed out that it is still too early for google to shake microsoft windows' dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> reporter's note: google shaking microsoft's throne? </seg>
<seg id="22"> huizhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in their life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> however, while everybody uses a computer skillfully, only a handful of people actually know the operating principle of a computer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> just as using a "foolproof" camera, as long as the interface is friendly and software is easy to use, most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> therefore, pc's manufacturer-installed original software will often determine the usage habits of most consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> it is exactly through this measure that microsoft commands a solid control of the pc operating system market. </seg>
<seg id="28"> now, google, microsoft's new rival, also intends to have its finger in the pie through this means. </seg>
<seg id="29"> a well-known economics media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "dell, hewlett packard, and other computer manufacturers started to treat their computer products as supermarket shelves and charge software companies "shelving fees." </seg>
<seg id="31"> winning bidders can have their software appear in the 'critical ten minutes' when users start their new computers so as to guide consumers to use their products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> this mode of charging fees resembles the way supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees." </seg>
<seg id="33"> doubtlessly, this phenomenon indicates microsoft's control is being loosened. </seg>
<seg id="34"> microsoft's managers warned bill gates that if google began to pay pc manufacturers to have their computers installed with google software when they are shipped out, then microsoft's hegemony will eventually be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> no matter what will be the outcome of the situation, microsoft's stable and easy days as number one may become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> after all, it is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne. </seg>
<seg id="37"> there are no big events in the eyes of quanda, and all events in the world are commonplace events. </seg>

</poster>
<seg id="3"> sword of justice: prospects for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> author: sword of justice </seg>
<seg id="5"> i remember that at the beginning of 2005, hong kong's apple daily published an article entitled "as falun wheel revolves, its contributions rival those of government." </seg>
<seg id="6"> the article called 2004 a year of great advancement for falun gong. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the article gave many examples of how overseas cpc officials completely lost their manners in suppressing falun gong on various occasions, while falun gong practitioners told the truth all over the world, making the cpc completely lose face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> however, in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the "nine commentaries" in 2005, the year 2004 did not seem impressive. </seg>
<seg id="9"> -well, what will things be like in 2006? </seg>
<seg id="10"> from two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year, we can probably see some clues about this year's developments. </seg>
<seg id="11"> one is the publication of "eliminating evils" by the falun gong founder.  this article announced the imminent doom of those who became cpc spies after july 20, 1999. </seg>
<seg id="12"> perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article. </seg>
<seg id="13"> yet, whether believing it or not, history and facts will be the proof! </seg>
<seg id="14"> of course, cpc spies are like rats living in the sewer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> their "natural or accidental" deaths won't rouse social or public attention. </seg>
<seg id="16"> but the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by cpc spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the cpc power structure. </seg>
<seg id="17"> stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination, they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party, defection, or counterattack. </seg>
<seg id="18"> consequently, "the cpc ultra stable bureaucracy group" maintained by filthy interests will start to shake, crumble, and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by gao zhisheng to safeguard human rights. </seg>
<seg id="20"> this movement, which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning, on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world, and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that. </seg>
<seg id="21"> if this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses, making it a widespread success, then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable, evil cpc regime. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if we say 2005 was a year in which the cpc was destroyed spiritually, then 2006 will begin a phase in which the cpc will be eliminated both spiritually and materially. </seg>
<seg id="23"> with the further spread of the "nine commentaries" and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party, with the internal collapse of the cpc and the convergence of external forces of justice, the life of the cpc devil will officially enter the count-down period. </seg>
<seg id="24"> the intent of heaven and the people is harmonious; the power of god and the people are converging. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the giant sword is pointing directly at the cpc devil. </seg>
<seg id="26"> if we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a year of surging momentum, then what will be the final conclusion for 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope it is stunning transformation and triumph! </seg>

<seg id="5"> subject: xu zhiyong: a letter to li qun, linyi municipal party committee secretary - hooliganism may also harm yourself </seg>
<seg id="6"> mailing station: feel like old friends at the first meeting (wed feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this station (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> as of yesterday the linyi government under your leadership had illegally put chen guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> you people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> you people have cut off the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> you people have also beat him and his family members several times. </seg>
<seg id="11"> you people's barbarism has exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> in early october 2005, you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat attorney li fangping and me, but we put up with it, always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in.  we even acquiesced for some time after you people put chen guangcheng under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, 165 days have passed.  instead of refraining yourself, you people even have become more unscrupulous. </seg>
<seg id="14"> you people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> you people continued to detain and beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> you people have gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> today, as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in chen guangcheng, i remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> things at the very beginning should have warranted your reconsideration. </seg>
<seg id="19"> family planning in linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province. </seg>
<seg id="20"> it was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary. </seg>
<seg id="21"> however, you were wrong to think that people in linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government's action? </seg>
<seg id="23"> was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time? </seg>
<seg id="24"> if the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd, don't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the constitution? </seg>
<seg id="25"> why don't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your linyi alone dare do such things? </seg>
<seg id="26"> how could it be that your linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law? </seg>
<seg id="27"> after chen guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law, after teng biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens' rights got involved, and after the national family planning commission made the conclusion of the investigation, linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> after all, family planning is a tough subject with chinese characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="29"> people could also have understood your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> yet, you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back to be locked up.  you even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="31"> don't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> in fact, as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job, would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person? </seg>
<seg id="33"> would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him? </seg>
<seg id="34"> on october 4, 2005, attorney li fangping and i went to dongshigu village.  we made our position very clear and hoped to resolve the contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="35"> we proposed that we could talk with your officials first to find out what idea and request you people had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> we offered to help you persuade chen guangcheng not to make certain remarks. </seg>
<seg id="37"> it was our hope that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> however, your policy makers were bent on having your way, and furthermore, even "masterminded" an incident of beating and illegally detaining us. </seg>
<seg id="39"> do you think you can scare us this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> we have not done anything illegal. </seg>
<seg id="41"> we are not afraid of anything. </seg>
<seg id="42"> although the rule of law in china is imperfect, it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="43"> if you think you can scare us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society, then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower. </seg>
<seg id="44"> as long as we want, we have many people who have many lawful reasons to go to linyi or visit chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> you can beat attorneys and scholars once, twice, and three times.  each time there will be widespread attention and coverage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> do you people dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> don't you care very much about your official position? </seg>
<seg id="48"> in case someone is injured by beating, is your position really that secure? </seg>
<seg id="49"> playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice, don't you think this is not only foolish but also risky? </seg>
<seg id="50"> i want to tell you clearly that in china there is a large number of excellent citizens who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="51"> we are not afraid of hooligans and the underground society. </seg>
<seg id="52"> we cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> if you are going to the extreme, we will go toward your batons and sticks with confidence and ease in groups and by turns until the moment you retreat. </seg>
<seg id="54"> you should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> don't think you can extricate yourself from those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="56"> finally, i also want to remind you to treat chen guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> blind since a child, he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and english.  he once sued the beijing subway company in the interest of the blind people, and he introduced running water for the villagers.  he is known far and wide as "attorney chen." </seg>
<seg id="58"> you people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients.  don't you think you have gone too far by doing that? </seg>
<seg id="59"> it is illegal for you people to put chen guangcheng under house arrest.  it is also risky to you. </seg>
<seg id="60"> originally, you people could have released him with no trouble. </seg>
<seg id="61"> since the barbarous implementation of the law has stopped, how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked? </seg>
<seg id="62"> but, you people are now continuing to smear your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> as long as cheng guangcheng is not free, you people will never have peace. </seg>
<seg id="64"> you people have tortured him enough. </seg>
<seg id="65"> if you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism, we will never look on with folded arms. </seg>

<seg id="12"> in fact i don't have to worry about the future of china at all. </seg>
<seg id="13"> that's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> this is just a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> i only lament that the chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history, they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you.  just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road, and even force us to be proud of such glory. </seg>

<seg id="21"> when a democratic system was established in athens, when a republic was founded in rome, when the magna carta was approved by the british people, when the french people were issuing the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen, and when americans were issuing the declaration of independence, what were chinese people doing? </seg>
<seg id="22"> before the mongols took control of the central plains, khuriltai were used to elect emperors.  the manchus long ago had the council of princes and ministers to practice democratic administration.  why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the han people? </seg>

<seg id="4"> the dalai lama stressed that he wants autonomy, not independence, for tibet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the special envoys of the dalai lama, tibet's spiritual leader in exile, are having closed-door meetings with chinese officials in beijing with no details released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> this is the fifth official meeting between china and the dalai's government-in-exile since contacts resumed in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> however, as always, the two sides met behind close doors with no details revealed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the dalai lama, who is in exile in northern india, said that he wants autonomy, not independence, for tibet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the chinese side refused to comment on the bilateral talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, analysts said that beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that tibetans' dissatisfaction with the chinese rule may escalate should this 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile die. </seg>
<seg id="12"> cultural identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> the delegation of dalai's government-in-exile was led by lodi gyaltsen gyari, who was also chief representative to several previous talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> a spokesperson for the tibetan government-in-exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with chinese officials in switzerland in 2005 were very "close and frank," bringing hopes for tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the spokesperson said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the chinese leadership so that tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity, which they consider important. </seg>

<seg id="18"> the dalai lama will go to visit washington this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> prior to the tibetan spiritual leader dalai lama's visit to the united states on november 8, his special envoys said that the tibetan government-in-exile would not demand for tibet's independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> lodi gyaltsen gyari said in washington that he hoped the chinese government would indeed preserve tibet's unique culture and tradition. </seg>
<seg id="21"> during his visit to the us next week, the dalai lama is expected to discuss the tibetan issue with president bush in hopes that bush can urge the chinese government to give tibet genuine autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> dalai's representative had direct contact with beijing officials for the first time in berne in july of this year. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "genuine autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> lodi gyaltsen gyari noted that in recent years the tibetan government-in-exile has seen some positive aspects when meeting with chinese authorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the dalai lama's special envoys found that beijing leaders, especially the representatives from the united front work department of the cpc central committee, were more willing than before to hear their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> however, lodi gyaltsen gyari said that the tibetan government-in-exile still has too many disagreements with the chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="27"> he said that during the past five years the tibetan government-in-exile has tried its best to meet the chinese request for creating a good negotiation environment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> china should also create a good environment for negotiations on the tibetan issue instead of suppressing the dalai lama unrelentingly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> he said that the dalai lama does not demand independence for tibet.  tibet is still part of china, but the chinese government must preserve tibet's unique culture so that "tibetans will have genuine autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> in addition, lodi gyaltsen gyari noted that some chinese think the tibetan issue will disappear once the dalai lama dies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> he said that this idea is very dangerous because china will lose a historic opportunity to solve the tibetan issue once the dalai lama passes away. </seg>
<seg id="32"> he said that as long as the chinese government responds to the requests of the dalai lama and proposes a final resolution, the dalai lama will not need to talk about the tibetan issue internationally. </seg>

<seg id="1"> negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods! (zt) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> i just saw a post by a net friend on the great spirit: to old mr. guiren. </seg>
<seg id="4"> his/her original words were "negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods, or else, splitting because of disagreements is the failure of democracy!!!  i hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> this bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at this time, i thought of ancient china as well as the past of the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> seldom posting topics, i could not help replying to the post of this net friend in the form of a topic post. </seg>
<seg id="8"> let's take a look first at ancient china. </seg>
<seg id="9"> everybody knows that beginning with the first qin emperor, china has constructed a large and unified centralized power system, with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> although a "double-track system" was temporarily implemented in the han dynasty, that is, a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system, after all, there was still a centralized power system in the end. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side, had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production. </seg>
<seg id="12"> however, we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity, initiative, and activity in local areas, making it even less possible to formulate, based on local conditions, various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development. </seg>
<seg id="13"> the pyramid-like system of government also caused lower-level officials to only look upward, following every detail of orders from higher levels. </seg>
<seg id="14"> since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government, they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves, let alone with those ordinary citizens. </seg>
<seg id="15"> when their rights were infringed upon, peasants in ancient china could do nothing but put up with it time and again. </seg>
<seg id="16"> only when their most basic rights were threatened, that is, when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine, tyranny, and natural disasters, would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> over 2,000 years, several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country, from the spontaneous chen sheng wu guang uprising to the plotted yellow turban uprising, to the huang chao riot in the tang dynasty, as well as the one-month dynastic rule as a result of li zicheng's uprising.  except for zhu yuanzhang, none achieved victory in the true sense of the word. </seg>
<seg id="18"> even the ming dynasty established this way by zhu yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties, with no change in the system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> born a commoner with little education, zhu yuanzhang implemented ancient china's centralized power system to a sickening extreme.  the brimming vitality characteristic of the tang dynasty, born of openness, freedom, and tolerance, was replaced by stagnant lifelessness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of china for some time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> human nature suffered utmost suppression. </seg>
<seg id="22"> everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much, from fear and trepidation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> the result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> now let's take a look at the middle ages in western europe, known as the dark ages. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the middle ages in western europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after western rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient greece and rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> this period was characterized by fiefdoms, namely land fiefdoms. </seg>
<seg id="27"> landlords at lower levels had more independent power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and barons who appeared on formal occasions, as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another, with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king, there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests, scenes never seen in ancient chinese history. </seg>
<seg id="29"> they made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force. </seg>
<seg id="30"> this way, by means of various kinds of contracts, rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners, and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners, the king's rights became increasingly diminished. </seg>
<seg id="31"> in the end, the british queen became only ceremonial, with no actual power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> democracy was gradually realized through this method! </seg>
<seg id="33"> let's come back to make a comparison with ancient china, with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor (except for li shimin) and with almost no noblemen.  it would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine, making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="34"> under such circumstances, when the right of existence was deprived, the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> consequently, there was a repeated rotation, from the heyday of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the ming dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> comparing chinese history with western history, we find there seems to be no western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient china. </seg>
<seg id="37"> in no western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient china. </seg>
<seg id="38"> in western countries, when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose, noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests.  they would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights, while force was rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="39"> understanding this, you will see that even as we enter the 21st century, some democratic "fighters" on the internet, having inherited the idea of the ultra, absolute totalitarian system of the ming dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the cultural revolution, these democratic "fighters" can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow. </seg>
<seg id="41"> yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy, because these people don't understand that negotiation, consultation, and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> cao xiaoming: who foots bill for enriching rural cultural activities? </seg>
</hl>

<seg id="2"> houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> this spring festival, this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural china and visit some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> while impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural china, i was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at spring festival each year, this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called "revolving lantern." </seg>
<seg id="6"> both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the three warring kingdoms.  the villagers never grew tired of watching it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> there were several performing teams for "revolving lantern" across the township.  they not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages, creating liveliness through their exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="8"> however, this year this village no longer organized it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> it turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for "revolving lantern."  in the past, costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers, yet they are now too worn out to wear. </seg>
<seg id="10"> asking villagers door to door for money again, nobody wanted to do it.  similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township. </seg>
<seg id="11"> without the "revolving lantern," the village suddenly became cold and cheerless. </seg>
<seg id="12"> adults started to play mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> children also started to play poker. </seg>
<seg id="14"> villagers all said there was nothing going on for this new year festival. </seg>
<seg id="15"> setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the new year celebration in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="16"> meanwhile, gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further.  winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace.  in particular, a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses. </seg>
<seg id="17"> their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain. </seg>
<seg id="18"> in addition, gambling-related family disputes frequently occur.  some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death. </seg>
<seg id="19"> some peasants say they gamble not only during the new year festival, but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season. </seg>
<seg id="20"> there is no place to go if they don't gamble. </seg>
<seg id="21"> it is too difficult to organize some cultural activities, to find some fun in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="22"> there are neither facilities nor funds, but also there are no people acting as organizers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> however, in this regard, what jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population, the jiangxi provincial government, starting in september of last year, not only implemented "theatrical performances funded by the government, operated by the market, supported by townships, provided for peasant enjoyment," </seg>
<seg id="25"> but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises, so as to bring high-quality cultural products to the rural population. </seg>
<seg id="26"> at the start of the new year, 10 million yuan was again added, bringing the total amount to 100 million yuan for the establishment of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="27"> moreover, the "bills" paid with this special fund are for real benefits: </seg>
<seg id="28"> inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas, with at least four performances per year in each township; </seg>
<seg id="29"> inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to put on movies in rural areas, with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village; </seg>
<seg id="30"> organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics, with at least 2-3 events per year in each township. </seg>
<seg id="31"> from this "purchase inventory list," it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds, but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population.  it has done a real job. </seg>
<seg id="32"> currently, the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> if the government can do what jiangxi did to "foot the bill" for enriching rural people's cultural activities, it will be another joy from heaven for peasants. </seg>
<seg id="34"> furthermore, this "joy" will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them "active" in cultural activities, which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas. </seg>

<seg id="3"> wang peirong's child almost got kidnapped, but it turned out to be a false alarm. </seg>
<seg id="4"> some time after 9:00 p.m. on january 24, 2006, wang peirong's child gave a full account: </seg>
<seg id="5"> on the morning of january 24, 2006, wang peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard when she was attending a make-up class in physics in the xuzhou no. 3 middle school. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the entrance guard told wang peirong's child that three unidentified men said to the no. 3 middle school entrance guard, wang peirong's child wang tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents' quarrel. </seg>
<seg id="7"> now her mother has disappeared.  as we are the leaders at her mother's workplace, we want to go inside the no. 3 middle school to take away wang peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> wang peirong's child said to the entrance guard that what these three men said were all lies, and she refused to go with these three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> with the help of the no. 3 middle school entrance guard, wang peirong's child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wang peirong's child called her mother's leader at noon to investigate this incident, and that leader denied having sent anyone to the xuzhou no. 3 middle school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> wang peirong's child got her father's leader's telephone number from her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> wang peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> wang peirong's child said: "three people came to the no. 3 middle scholl and wanted to take me away." </seg>
<seg id="14"> that leader asked: "why didn't you go with them?" </seg>
<seg id="15"> wang peirong's child answered: "i will surely die if i go with them." </seg>
<seg id="16"> after saying that, wang peirong's child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> after hearing what wang peirong's child said, wang peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> on january 25, the feedback from the police station was that what wang peirong's child had said was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the police station asked the security department of the china university of mining and technology whether it had sent anyone to find wang peirong's child at the no. 3 middle school.  the answer was no. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the police station again asked the cumt security department whether the work unit affiliated with cumt had sent anyone to find wang peirong's child at the no. 3 middle school.  the answer was another no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the relevant department asked others to tell wang peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> after the incident, the leaders of the relevant departments in xuzhou city took it seriously. </seg>
<seg id="23"> through the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau, the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="24"> wang peirong thanked the leaders of the relevant departments in xuzhou city as well as the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau. </seg>
<seg id="25"> this was a false alarm, and the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the no. 3 middle school entrance guard. </seg>
<seg id="26"> the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou municipal public security bureau has now confirmed:  on january 24, three people including the leader from the school of science, wang peirong's workplace, could not find wang peirong by phone.  as they urgently needed to find wang peirong (wang peirong has so far no idea what that was about), they thought of going to the no. 3 middle school to find the teacher of wang peirong's child so as to ask whether the child was in xuzhou. </seg>
<seg id="27"> heavy topics:  why is there lower risk to engage in corruption while cost of anti-corruption is higher? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> with the current cadre mechanism and the anti-corruption mechanism, a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses. </seg>
<seg id="30"> therefore, once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate, he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will,  disregarding how the people close to him feel. </seg>
<seg id="31"> in contrast, when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice, they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge. </seg>
<seg id="32"> or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won. </seg>
<seg id="33"> comparing the two: those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead. </seg>

<seg id="1"> now let's look at iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> the international atomic energy agency (iaea) confirmed on the 6th that the iranian government had written to the agency requesting the removal of all equipments that monitor iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of the month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> since the iaea decided to report iran's nuclear issue to the un security council, iran had announced the termination of all supportive and cooperative measures it had adopted in the nuclear issue, and refused to allow the iaea to conduct any further surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> speaking on the tension in iran's nuclear issue, russia's foreign minister lavrov stated in athens, greece, on the 6th that the collaboration between russia and iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this will be the driving force in resolving iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> a spokesman for russia's ministry of foreign affairs claimed on the same day that russia's proposal to iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in russia is still effective. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the two parties may hold discussions on this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> on the same day, lugar, the u.s. senate foreign relations committee chairman, indicated at the un headquarters in new york that the united states disagreed with israel's attack on iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> recent reports claimed that israeli defense experts said that the israeli air force may deliver a heavy blow to iran's nuclear facilities if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the xinhua news agency reported that kislyak, russia's deputy foreign minister, stated on the 7th that russia is willing to cooperate with iran on the nuclear issue, assisting iran to obtain the legitimate right to peacefully develop nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="11"> kislyak said that russia's proposal on a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with iran is still effective. </seg>
<seg id="12"> russia hopes to discuss the issue with iran soon. </seg>
<seg id="13"> russia submitted a proposal to iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in russia at the end of last december. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the european union and the united states both indicated that they could accept this compromise plan. </seg>
<seg id="15"> iran hopes that russia can continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> kong quan, spokesman for china's ministry of foreign affairs, said on the 7th that even though the iaea had reported iran's nuclear issue to the un security council, it had not shifted its responsibility to handle iran's nuclear issue to the un security council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> thus, all parties still have to break the stalemate of iran's nuclear issue within the iaea's framework. </seg>
<seg id="18"> according to the iaea resolution, the agency's director-general elbaradei will submit a report on iran's nuclear issue to the un security council in march. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the un security council will make a final decision after evaluating the report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> we believe this resolution is asking iran to fulfill its obligations and commitments, but it is not transferring the iaea's responsibility on handling the iran nuclear issue to the un security council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> recently, china has been seeking peaceful resolutions to iran's nuclear problem through diplomatic channels for some time. </seg>
<seg id="22"> kong quan said that zhang yan, director-general of china's department of arms control and disarmament at the foreign ministry, had held talks on iran's nuclear issue with larijani, secretary of iran's supreme national security council and chief negotiator, in tehran on february 1. </seg>
<seg id="23"> china hopes that iran will take great stock in the emphasis of the international community and create conditions for a peaceful solution to iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> to solve the iranian nuclear issue within the iaea framework serves not only china's interest, but also the interest of all parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> therefore, we again call on the parties concerned in the international community not to quit the diplomatic effort that has been conducted on this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> let's look at a few japanese news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> there is a rather shocking piece of news in japanese politics recently. </seg>
<seg id="3"> tsuneo watanabe, president of the yomiuri shimbun, a leading outlet in japan's media, instructed the yomiuri shimbun to publish um, articles criticizing koizumi's visit to the yasukuni shrine. since then, the yomiuri shimbun has held the same position on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> er, well, um, tsuneo watanabe railed against koizumi in um, his speech a few days ago, calling him very ignorant, and that he does not know any history or culture. </seg>
<seg id="5"> he also equated the visitation of the yasukuni shrine to the glorification of hitler. he added that such an act by koizumi has made china and korea consider japan as an extremely dangerous nation, which will cause endless trouble. </seg>
<seg id="6"> why would tsuneo watanabe's position create huge shock waves? </seg>
<seg id="7"> in fact, he is very influential in politics and has always been a hidden hand. </seg>
<seg id="8"> he had been a far rightist in the past. </seg>
<seg id="9"> he had supported the hawks and aggressively promoted the revision of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> however, it is a um, huge turn now. </seg>
<seg id="11"> he has turned the cannon around to start bombing koizumi and opposing such a position. </seg>
<seg id="12"> actually, in 2004 when people criticized koizumi for visiting the yasukuni shrine, um, tsuneo watanabe still claimed that, he claimed that he supported koizumi, and asked him to stand up to the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> nonetheless, he made a speech recently saying, "i'll be 80 years old this year. i have very little time left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> well, now he comes forward and makes anti-war speeches in a lofty tone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> his change in um, allegiance no doubt creates a huge impact on japanese, um society. </seg>
<seg id="16"> as tsuneo watanabe put it himself, "i believe i have the confidence and the ability to change the political situation." </seg>
<seg id="17"> he added that if the government exerts pressure on the freedom of speech and assembly and the editorial freedom of the yomiuri shimbun, he would risk his life to resist. </seg>
<seg id="18"> then, what kind of situation has been formed now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> japan's largest newspaper, the yomiuri shimbun, and its second largest newspaper, um, the %pw asahi shimbun, the two major newspapers have joined hands in opposing koizumi's visit to the yasukuni shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> originally, the two major newspapers were two opposing groups. however, after the two presidents met, at least they had reached a consensus on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="21"> thus, they both adopt strong offensives in um, railing against koizumi. it can be said that they have formed a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> in fact, these two major newspapers have huge, um, influence on the mainstream public opinion in japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> moreover, let us look at the meeting of the um, house of representatives in japan. in a recent meeting, the same remark was made by the top two successor candidates um, of um, japan's prime minister junichiro koizumi. </seg>
<seg id="24"> who were these two people? </seg>
<seg id="25"> %pw one was shinzo abe, chief cabinet secretary, and the other was taro aso, japan's foreign minister, who has repeatedly made um, shocking remarks in recent days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> what remark did both of them make? </seg>
<seg id="27"> they both said that japan's war criminals of the second world war were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> what they meant was that er, it was the international court that called them um, criminals and convicted them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> while in japan, according to international laws, according to japanese laws, er, the war criminals had not broken any japanese laws. </seg>
<seg id="30"> thus, they argued that war criminals of the second world war should not be considered as criminals in japan. </seg>
<seg id="31"> in the meantime, um, shinzo abe mentioned that japan should now have the whole world in view and develop its relationship with the united states and business and trading ties with um, east asian countries. moreover, it should develop close ties with india instead of focusing on china all the time. </seg>

<seg id="1"> championship hopeful but not a sure thing </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> loving life and luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> the gunpowder smoke of the chinese super cup soccer game will soon bring flames of war. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the luneng team of taishan is ready for the new game season, and is preparing to rush to the championship again. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the battles for seizing dominance among lian, lu, and hu, the three strong teams, will break out at any moment. </seg>
<seg id="6"> who will win the championship at last? </seg>
<seg id="7"> based on an analysis of actual strengths, although the taishan team has a great hope of seizing the championship, it has no full certainty of success. </seg>
<seg id="8"> first, the time for new team members to adapt to each other is short. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the taishan team had nothing new last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the taishan team introduced li leilei and wang liang, the two members from the national team, this year. soon after that, it will also add two members to the team from foreign teams, and its actual strength should be seen as increased, not reduced. </seg>
<seg id="11"> but because the national team is preparing for the matches with the palestinian and iraqi teams, those members of the national team cannot coordinate with the members of this team. </seg>
<seg id="12"> when they return to the football club, the league matches will start right away, </seg>
<seg id="13"> so, the issue of adapting to each other is the biggest issue the taishan team is facing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> i think that those members from the national team can be substitute players for the first several rounds of games in the league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> firstly, they can be trained to adapt to the team in matches; </seg>
<seg id="16"> secondly, those national team members who have played two group matches can have a rest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> after several rounds of matches, their edge would be honed, and it won't be too late for them to participate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> second, its defense has hidden problems. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the defense of the taishan team was scolded as a sick one by its fans last year. </seg>
<seg id="20"> li leilei was introduced this year, and has improved the defense, but the team has not reached the time for sitting back and relaxing. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the problem of center halfbacks' and fullbacks' slowness in turning back still exists, and those substitute players are either older in age or lack experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if center halfbacks and fullbacks can solidly play their roles, the taishan team would have one more advantage in its path to seizing the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> i think that it does not hurt to use ren yongshun who has good physical qualities, although lacking experience. he can exercise this year in preparation for the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> and also, it is ok to withdraw gao rao to play fullback. </seg>
<seg id="25"> many members of the taishan team can play fullback, including cui peng and hai bin. </seg>
<seg id="26"> gao rao is strong physically, and can aggressively and fiercely intercept the ball, and should be able to do a good job in the position of either center halfback or fullback. </seg>
<seg id="27"> third, whether foreign players can adapt to the team. </seg>
<seg id="28"> the introduction of foreign players is a big issue that has been puzzling the taishan team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> nobody dares to say anything good about dan qiu's performance last year. </seg>
<seg id="30"> it is known that foreign players have not been selected for introduction for this year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> i think that in addition to introduction of an outstanding forward, a very good left-foot forward should be introduced too. </seg>
<seg id="32"> except xing rui, who played on the taishan team several years ago, there has not been a real left-foot player on the team. </seg>
<seg id="33"> although some players like cui peng can play the role, a real left-foot forward would be much better than one who is a guest player. </seg>
<seg id="34"> if these three issues can be solved well, the path for the taishan team to seize the championship should be somewhat smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> as a shandong football fan, i really hope that the taishan team will be able to seize the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> but frankly speaking, the taishan team is very hopeful, but has no full guarantee of winning the championship this year. </seg>

<seg id="3"> read this article, and wanted to share it with people. </seg>
<seg id="4"> this is not an impulsion, but warmness and kindness staying in my heart for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> i ask myself if it were me, what i would do. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the answer is very clear. i would hang up the phone, "you dialed a wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> this year i have been thinking about what really counts for helping people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> i have given up tentative conduct, such as donations of cash or items. </seg>
<seg id="9"> some friend said a couple of days ago that he has no time to take care of himself, not mention to help people, even though his desire for providing help is bigger than his ability. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wish you a happy day :) </seg>

<seg id="12"> mom of ten years ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> it was one day ten years ago when this teacher was taking a nap by using the rest time at noon. suddenly, the phone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> she picked up the phone, and heard a strange and rude voice: "your child stole a book, and we caught her. come and hurry up!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> the crying noise of a little girl and denouncing voices from others came out of the handset. </seg>
<seg id="16"> she understood the thing immediately when she turned her head and looked at her only daughter, who was watching tv. </seg>
<seg id="17"> there must be a little girl who was caught by the saleswoman for stealing a book. she does not want her family members to know this, so she made up a phone number, and a phone call happens to come here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> she could of course hang up the phone and give no response, and even scold the other side. </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this thing has nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> but she herself is a teacher; maybe that girl is one of her pupils. </seg>
<seg id="21"> she could probably imagine through the phone that that little girl, who made a wrong decision at that moment, must be very panicked, and may be facing the most terrible situation of her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> after she hesitated for a moment, she suddenly had an idea in her mind. yes, i will do it this way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> then, she asked for the detailed address of the bookstore, and hurried there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> as she expected, a little girl with tear stains all over her face was standing in the bookstore. </seg>
<seg id="25"> and those adults standing around were scolding her ferociously in loud voices. </seg>
<seg id="26"> she rushed to the poor little girl and held her in her arms, and turned her head to the sales clerks around, and said: "talk to me if you have something to say. do not terrify the child." </seg>
<seg id="27"> she took the little girl with her and walked out of the bookstore after she paid out several dozen yuan as a fine, while the sales clerks were whispering reluctantly. then, she could clearly see the face messed with tears and panic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> she smiled, and brought the little girl home. she cleaned her up thoroughly and let her go without asking anything. </seg>
<seg id="29"> she especially urged her before she left, "if you want to read books, you could come here, auntie's home has a lot of books." </seg>
<seg id="30"> the little girl, who was still in a panic, gazed at her deeply before running away, and never showed up again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> time passes as quickly as running water, and a period of ten years has passed in a flash without notice. </seg>
<seg id="32"> she had forgotten the thing a long time ago, and still lives there with a calm and serene life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> one afternoon, knocking noises came from outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> a young and strange girl with a pretty face appeared when she opened the door. she had a big smile on her face and was holding a big pile of gifts in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked with doubt. </seg>
<seg id="37"> the girl was moved and talked with a lot of words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> it was not easy for her to find out from the strange girl's talking that she was the little girl of that year. ten years after, she had graduated from a university without any difficulties, and now she had made a special trip to see her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> the young girl said with a soft voice and tears in her eyes: "although i still don't understand why you were willing to pretend to be my mom and save me, during these 10 years, i have always felt that i want to call you mom." </seg>
<seg id="40"> the teacher's eyes also started to become blurred. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "if i did not help you that day, what was going to happen to you?" she asked with curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="42"> the face of the girl suddenly became gloomy. she shook her head slightly and said, "i cannot explain it clearly, i might have done a stupid thing or even killed myself." </seg>
<seg id="43"> the teacher felt a sudden jump in her heart, and began to rejoice in her mind. </seg>
<seg id="44"> the decision she made at that moment in that year could even impact a person in her life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> looking at the happy smile on the face of that girl, she also smiled with her. </seg>

<seg id="49"> any human being has a kind personality when he starts his life. </seg>

<seg id="1"> military situation observation: how long can iran hold up under air attacks by us armed forces? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> if traditional warfare of attrition is described as letting an opponent bleed to death, then modern warfare is shooting at the head of an opponent first and making him a "human vegetable" before he bleeds. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the gap between the military capabilities of iran and the united states is not their quantities, but understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> iran, which came to a draw with iraq in an eight-year war, does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the british international intelligence comments pointed out a few days ago, after it analyzed the state of us armed forces movements, that the us armed forces are preparing to launch large-scale air attacks on iran... </seg>
<seg id="7"> the current status of the iranian air force is worrisome. </seg>
<seg id="8"> the present status of the iranian air forces is quite similar with that of the iraqi air force before the iraq war in 2003. </seg>
<seg id="9"> iran itself does not have the capacity to independently develop modern weapons, and is embargoed from importing weapons from the west. </seg>
<seg id="10"> once a war breaks out, it is really a question of whether those old and obsolete aircrafts of the iranian air force could take off to confront the us armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> currently, the iranian air defense system is mainly composed of the air force and ground air defense troops of the iranian regular armed forces, and the air-defense forces of the revolutionary guard corps. </seg>
<seg id="12"> among them, the iranian air forces have around 50,000 troops, and more than 300 various types of combat aircrafts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> their primary aircraft models include the f-4 "phantom," f-5 "tiger," and f-14 "tomcat" made by the us and the mig-29 made by russia, etc. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the ground air defense troops are mainly equipped with surface to air missiles, including the us "hawk," british "javelin" and some of the russian "sam" series of missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> harold hutchinson, a us military expert, and helamuchisin, a military expert from russia's politics and military analysis institute, analyzed the current status of the iranian air defense forces, and think that the iranian air defense capacities and air defense system and construction still have some loopholes in the current status. </seg>
<seg id="16"> hutchinson thinks that the iranian air forces are not at all at the same level with the us armed forces from the perspective of whole actual strength. </seg>
<seg id="17"> a lot of the iranian combat aircrafts made by the us cannot be used because of lack of parts, upgrades, and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the f-14 fighter planes previously regarded as the elite ones in the iranian air force only have about ten capable of taking off from the ground. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the combat reliability of aim 54 "phoenix" missiles, claimed to be capable of over-the-horizon attacks, is also doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="20"> helamuchisin pointed out that those iranian air defense missile systems provided by the us from the 1970s to the 1980s of the last century have lost their combat powers because of lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> and other air defense weapons that do not form any systems, such as weapons obtained from russia and other countries, have no capabilities at all to cope with the us armed forces, which have powerful electromagnetic combat capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="22"> scrappy weapons affect combat power </seg>
<seg id="23"> apparently, the iranian government realizes that its fate in a war depends on whether it is capable of defending the sky over its head, and is starting to prepare only at the last moment, scrape weapons together, and strengthen its air defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> its methods can be summed up as the two strategies from the current state: </seg>
<seg id="25"> the first one is to conceal important nuclear facilities as much as possible and strengthen their anti-strike capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to a report from the british newspaper times, iran has hidden core parts of its nuclear facilities 18 meters under ground and added a protection shell of 2-meter-thick cement, including the nuclear plant in natanz and the uranium enrichment center in isfahan. </seg>
<seg id="27"> but the us armed forces have taken a strategy in advance. they saw the effects of underground bunkers in anti-air attack combat as early as during the gulf war in 1991, and have rushed developing various ground-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> through more than 10 years' studies on targets, the us armed forces have had a whole set of combat methods and weapons coping with underground consolidated bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> iran has also purchased a lot of advanced air defense weapons from russia in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="30"> since the end of last year, the iranian government has reached agreements with russia, one after another, for the purchase of the pechora-2a air defense missile system and 29 sets of "dower" air defense missile systems, worth 700 million us dollars. </seg>
<seg id="31"> however, a modern war is a rivalry between systems. </seg>
<seg id="32"> various us armed forces air-attack weapons are developed by the us itself, and they have been sharpened and become a set of war machines with outstanding effects after years of tests in actual warfare. </seg>
<seg id="33"> and those "new weapons" scraped together by iran from other countries are still a question of whether they can form combat power in a short time. </seg>
<seg id="34"> weapons are not iran's only gap. </seg>
<seg id="35"> combat outlines, published by the us armed forces in 1982, first came up with the idea of "integrated air-ground warfare," and stressed the use of air supremacy to strike high-value targets in an enemy's strategic depth area, paralyzing the enemy's command system at the beginning of a war, and making him as "meat on the cutting board" even though he has very powerful conventional forces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> in the gulf war in 1991, kosovo war in 1999, and the iraq war in 2003, what the us armed forces paid attention to was not how many aircrafts the opponents had, but the firing range of their own "tomahawk" cruise missile. </seg>
<seg id="37"> although the iranian government has prepared for possible air attacks and started to take measures to strengthen air defense capabilities, iran, which came to a draw with iraq in an eight-year war, does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> with the development of us armed forces military transition work in recent years, the air-attack activities of the us armed forces are totally different from the carpet bombing method in the vietnam war era, and rely on various new high-tech weapons and high-precision and whole-depth air strikes that are based on modern information technology. </seg>
<seg id="39"> how long the iranian ground air defense system can sustain itself in this kind of air strikes is still an unknown element. </seg>

<seg id="1"> rivaling microsoft by uniting with google; is dell collecting a "stocking fee?" </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> dell inc. (us; dell) and google confirmed on tuesday that dell is testing personal computers loaded with google's software packages. </seg>
<seg id="4"> this move might pose a serious threat to the dominant status of microsoft corp., msft, in the pc software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> jess blackburn, the news spokesman for dell corporation, said that the corporation is assessing google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> after the software is installed, pc users can use the software to search not only on the internet, but also for information stored on their pcs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> blackburn confirmed that the software the corporation is testing includes the dell homepage supported by google, google's desktop search system and google's toolbar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> google's news spokesman, jon murchinson, also confirmed at the same time that his company is testing a batch of software, developed by google, with dell. </seg>
<seg id="9"> as the wall street journal previously reported, google - the it new baron - is negotiating with dell and hewlett-packard co., and is trying to persuade these computer manufacturing giants to install google's software for their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> according to an internal source cited by the wall street journal, to achieve the goal, google might pay 1 billion dollars to dell in the coming three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, neither company has disclosed related details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> and also, the hewlett-packard side has refused to make a comment on it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> the microsoft corporation news spokesman, neil charney, refused to make a comment on the news mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="14"> microsoft is currently planning to promote its next-generation search tool for the windows operating system and strengthen development of its online business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> on the day the news was released, google's stock price fell another 4.46%, dropping to 367.92 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="16"> the microsoft's stock price fell 1%, and closed at 26.94 dollars on that day. </seg>
<seg id="17"> some analysts pointed out that google is anxious to seek another direction of expansion in addition to network searches, and that its integration with dell and other pc giants might prompt google to threaten microsoft's core business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> matt rosoff, an analyst on microsoft's direction at a market investigation and research company, said that microsoft is absolutely concerned and worried that google is eager to expand its new income sources. </seg>
<seg id="19"> but some analysts do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> charles di bona, an analyst at market analysis company sanford c. bernstein, pointed out that it is too early for google to shake microsoft's dominant status. </seg>
<seg id="21"> reporter's journal: google shakes microsoft's domination? </seg>
<seg id="22"> hui zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> there is no doubt that computers have become necessities in the life and work of modern people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> however, there is only a minority of people who understand the working rationale of computers, when everyone can skillfully operate them. </seg>
<seg id="25"> like they use "dummy" cameras, most "newbies" can play the black boxes well as long as those boxes have friendly interfaces, and convenient and simple software. </seg>
<seg id="26"> thus, original software installed on a pc manufacturer's products can usually determine most consumers' using habits. </seg>
<seg id="27"> it is through this measure that microsoft has tightly controlled the pc operating system market. </seg>
<seg id="28"> right now, google, a new rival of microsoft, tends to share part of the market through the same measure. </seg>
<seg id="29"> a well-known economics medium in taiwan recently made a very interesting metaphor. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "computer manufacturers including dell and hewlett-packard are starting to use computers like shelves in a supermarket and are collecting the "stocking fee" from software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> a successful bidder can make its own software show up in the 'critical ten minutes' when users turn on their new computers, and guide consumers to use its products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> this kind of fee collection mode is like how a supermarket collects stocking fees from food manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="33"> this phenomenon demonstrates that microsoft's control power is beginning to loosen without a doubt. </seg>
<seg id="34"> managers at microsoft have warned bill gates that the microsoft's hegemonic status will eventually be threatened if google starts to pay pc manufacturers for installation of google's software on their computer products. </seg>
<seg id="35"> no matter what the outcome is, the number one status that microsoft has been enjoying in those comfortable days may become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> after all, it is easy to become dominant, but it is difficult to maintain a dominant status. </seg>
<seg id="37"> nothing is big in the eyes of quanda, and everything is a common one in the world. </seg>

<seg id="3"> just sword: prospects for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> author: just sword </seg>
<seg id="5"> i remember that in the beginning of 2005, apple journal in hong kong published an article titled "dharma wheel spins constantly and its merits can overcome an enemy country." </seg>
<seg id="6"> the article alleged that 2004 was a year in which falun gong advanced rapidly while singing triumphant songs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the article stated that overseas officials of the chinese communist party acted like buffoons suppressing falun gong in various places, and totally lost face when beginning falun gong learners told the truths everywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="8"> but compared with the marvelous scene showing the great wave of party membership withdrawal brought by the "nine comments" in 2005, 2004 does not seem outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="9"> then, how will 2006 be? </seg>
<seg id="10"> the two events that occurred at the beginning of this year can probably demonstrate some development track for this year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> one is the article "elimination of evil" published by the founder of falun gong. this article announced and sentenced that those agents of the chinese communist party will face their coming judgment day after july 20, 1999. </seg>
<seg id="12"> maybe many people still have doubts about or disbelieve this article. </seg>
<seg id="13"> but no matter whether they believe it or not, the history and facts will prove it! </seg>
<seg id="14"> of course, those agents of the chinese communist party (ccp) are like rats living in dark ditches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> their "natural or accidental death" will not draw attention from the society and public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> but broad deaths or remorse of ccp agents at home and abroad brought by the heavens will definitely bring powerful strikes and shake the power strata of the ccp. </seg>
<seg id="17"> they will have to carefully consider their path of retreat and road for life - withdrawal from the party, desertion or changing their side under the awesome deterrence of the elimination brought by the heavens. </seg>
<seg id="18"> thus, the "superbly stable bureaucratic system and group of the ccp" will begin to be shaken, disrupted, and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> the other event is the hunger strike campaign for human rights launched by gao zhicheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> this suddenly arisen campaign, which did not receive a good prediction from some people in the beginning, unexpectedly brought warm reactions from everywhere in the world, and common responses from all strata and various forces. </seg>
<seg id="21"> if this activity can integrate various just forces and suffering masses into a connection and make it real and big, then the outside force that launches the final strike on the ccp, the evil regime that is as fragile as a pile of eggs, will finally be formed from it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if we say that 2005 was a year when the communist party was eliminated from the perspective of the spiritual aspect, then 2006 will be the phase in which the party will be gotten rid of in both the spiritual and material aspects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> with the further spread of the "nine comments" and further development of the wave of party membership withdrawal, the self-disruption of the ccp, and the cohesion and formation of outside just forces, the life of the ccp monster will formally enter into a countdown state. </seg>
<seg id="24"> the wills of the heavens and humans have been integrated, and the sacred power and human strength are gathering. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the long sword in the sky is directly pointed at the ccp monster! </seg>
<seg id="26"> if we say that 2004 was a year for advancing rapidly while singing triumphant songs, and 2005 is a marvelous year, then what will be the conclusion of 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope it will be a shocking great change, and a victory and triumphant return! </seg>

<seg id="5"> title: xu zhiyong: a letter to li qun, the secretary of linyi city party committee: hooliganism will also harm yourself </seg>
<seg id="6"> website for sending mail: feeling like old friends at the first meeting (wed feb 8 13:56:14 2006). this website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> until yesterday, the government of linyi, led by you, had illegally placed chen guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> you collaborated with rogues and the mafia society to put a blind legal citizen in jail illegally for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> you cut off his home's phone line, installed a cell phone jamming device in his yard; </seg>
<seg id="10"> you also beat him and his family members many times. </seg>
<seg id="11"> your barbarous conduct has gone beyond the bottom line of a civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> you also used means of rogues and the mafia society to beat me and lawyer li fangping in the beginning of october, 2005. but we bore this, and we always tried to understand your difficult situation as much as possible, and were even acquiescent for a time of the house arrest of chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, 165 days have passed. you not only have not controlled your behavior, but you also make it worse. </seg>
<seg id="14"> you sent a big team of policemen and rogues to harass villagers; </seg>
<seg id="15"> you continued to arrest and beat villagers; </seg>
<seg id="16"> what you have done is too outrageous! </seg>
<seg id="17"> today, i clearly remind you that those means of rogues and the mafia society will harm yourself in turn at the moment when you continue to organize rogues and the mafia society to besiege chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> it was worth your examination when this thing started in the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the family planning of linyi is the first one from the bottom of the provincial list in the whole province. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the anxiety in your mind is understandable as the secretary of the city party committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> but it is wrong for you to think that only use of violence and force can implement the state's law and policy because of the low qualities of the people in linyi. </seg>
<seg id="22"> whose fault exactly is it that citizens do not coordinate with the conduct of the government? </seg>
<seg id="23"> is it because of the low qualities of the citizens or much less public trust, since the government has told too many lies and made too many schemes? </seg>
<seg id="24"> if (we) say that the same government's conduct was not that absurd ten years ago, in 2005 china's society has made obvious progress and human rights protection has been written into the constitution; don't you think that your barbarous conduct is too outrageous? </seg>
<seg id="25"> why don't you examine that only your linyi dares to act in this way? </seg>
<seg id="26"> why is only your linyi unable to practice law enforcement by using democratic and legal means? </seg>
<seg id="27"> linyi city should have been able to make a sincere explanation and make the public understand, after a batch of brave citizens including chen guangcheng reported about the fact of the barbarous law enforcement, a batch of citizens including teng biao - who dared to protect citizen's rights - were involved, and the investigation conclusion was made by the national family planning committee. </seg>
<seg id="28"> after all, family planning is a difficult topic with chinese characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="29"> everyone can understand your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> however, you took a further absurd measure - brought chen guangcheng back and put him in jail by catching him from beijing - and also tried to accuse him of illegally providing the state's confidential information. </seg>
<seg id="31"> don't you think that it is a very absurd accusation for a blind man who lives in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> in fact, as long as you have truly corrected mistakes, as long as you have done things very well, are you still afraid of the criticism of a blind man? </seg>
<seg id="33"> is it necessary for you to send several dozens of people to watch him 24 hours a day, and even sentence him in a hurried and desperate way? </seg>
<seg id="34"> i and lawyer li fangping arrived in dongshigu village on october 4, 2005. we demonstrated our very clear position and hoped to solve the conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="35"> we made a suggestion that we could talk with your officials to learn your ideas and requests. </seg>
<seg id="36"> we took the initiative and suggested that we could help you to persuade chen guangcheng, to influence him not to say some of his words. </seg>
<seg id="37"> we hoped that you would not treat a blind man in this way, and both sides should make some compromises. </seg>
<seg id="38"> however, your decision maker just follow his own way, and moreover, even had "carefully planned" an episode - to beat and put us in jail illegally. </seg>
<seg id="39"> do you think that your activities can make us scared? </seg>
<seg id="40"> we have not done anything that violates laws. </seg>
<seg id="41"> we are fearless. </seg>
<seg id="42"> although china's legal system is not perfect, at least it has not become absolutely lawless. </seg>
<seg id="43"> you think that use of means of rogues and the mafia society can scare us away, then you have greatly underestimated our determination and willpower. </seg>
<seg id="44"> as long as we would like to, we have many people who have many legitimate reasons to go to linyi or go to see chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> you can beat lawyers and scholars one, two, and three times, but every time would attract broad attention and reports about it. </seg>
<seg id="46"> do you really dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> don't you care about your official position very much? </seg>
<seg id="48"> if somebody is beaten and injured, will your position still be in a solid status? </seg>
<seg id="49"> not listening to our reasonable advice, instead using some indecent means of rogues, don't you think this is very silly and dangerous? </seg>
<seg id="50"> i want to tell you clearly that, in china, there is a big batch of excellent citizens who are loyal to conscience and follow the legal system. </seg>
<seg id="51"> we do not fear rogues and the mafia society. </seg>
<seg id="52"> we cannot stand reckless trampling on the bottom line of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> if you have done too much beyond boundaries, we will calmly and confidently march forward batch by batch toward your sticks until the moment when you retreat. </seg>
<seg id="54"> you should be clear that use of the means of rogues and the mafia society is not something good for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> do not think that you can get rid of any link connected with those local rogues or hooligans who beat villagers as long as you hide backstage. </seg>
<seg id="56"> finally, i also want to remind you to treat chen guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> a person who was blind from his childhood, graduated from a college of traditional chinese medicine, self-studied laws and english, and sued beijing subway company for the interest of the blind, and brought tap water for villagers, and became a well-known "lawyer chen" everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="58"> you even mobilized shameful indecent individuals to make rumors about and slander him, and tried to accuse him of illegally sending confidential information across the border. don't you think that what you did is too outrageous? </seg>
<seg id="59"> it is illegal for you to place chen guangcheng under house arrest, and it is also dangerous for you to do this. </seg>
<seg id="60"> you should have been able to release him for sure. </seg>
<seg id="61"> if the conduct of barbarous law enforcement has been stopped, how long could he maintain the criticism if you let him criticize it freely? </seg>
<seg id="62"> but today you are continuously smearing your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> you won't be peaceful as long as chen guangcheng has not been set for free for a day. </seg>
<seg id="64"> it is enough for you to make him suffer. </seg>
<seg id="65"> we would never stand by and do nothing if you still want to charge him with any crime or use further rogue means. </seg>

<seg id="3"> i admit very disappointedly that the chinese nation does not deserve to have democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> aren't those who post their messages here doing this thing now! </seg>
<seg id="5"> the pity is that there are not many people who go online and read it (compared with 1.4 billion). </seg>
<seg id="6"> those who go online and care and participate in these kinds of topics would be much fewer: i dare to allege that the number would be less than 1% of people online. </seg>
<seg id="7"> not to mention that this network has the golden shield project, which is the biggest, most thorough, advanced, expensive, and quality one. </seg>
<seg id="8"> it is true. </seg>
<seg id="9"> one could feel depressed, hopeless, helpless, and even think of surrendering, but if one wants to live a human life, whom can he depend on except that he himself struggles for it? </seg>
<seg id="10"> although doing a thing depends on human effort, and success relies on the heavens, i would think i am wrong if i have not made an effort for my own ideal, even though it is not successful, and i deserve to live like a dog. </seg>
<seg id="11"> making an effort for a just thing itself can make one's own life somewhat wonderful, and at least in his heart when he evaluates himself. </seg>
<seg id="12"> in fact, i do not need to be concerned about china's future at all, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the environment in the world is no longer allowing a regime that has not been elected to exist for long. </seg>
<seg id="14"> this is just a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> what i lament is that the chinese nation is very lucky to be led on the path to hell by a world-class great man and completely exploited from its bone and blood whenever it is at a historical turning point. even if somebody calls piles of white bones and areas of blood stains along the path as brilliances, and forces us to be proud of the brilliances. </seg>
<seg id="16"> everywhere has a dark night, but the longest one is in shenzhou (the sacred state). </seg>
<seg id="17"> people would suffer a lot when the qin emperor integrated with the confucian sage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> qin shihuang was an open tyranny and the confucian sage privately washed brains. </seg>
<seg id="19"> it is not that chinese people do not deserve to have democracy; it is because they have not had the democratic gene or their gene has been degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> a nation that has been established for more than three thousand years, it might have had democracy a long time ago if its national culture contained democratic elements. </seg>
<seg id="21"> what were chinese people doing when athens established a democratic system, rome set up a republic, the british passed the constitution, the french published the declaration of human rights, and the americans issued the declaration of independence? </seg>
<seg id="22"> mongolians had a kurultai system for selection of their king before they entered into zhong yuan; manchurians in their early time had a ministers council of the prince regent for democratic consultation. why were those systems all gone when they entered into the han region? </seg>
<seg id="23"> chinese people pursue materials only and have no interest in spiritual faith and political rights. </seg>

<seg id="4"> the dalai lama stressed that he hopes that tibet will have autonomy instead of independence. </seg>
<seg id="5"> an envoy of the dalai lama, the tibetan spiritual leader in exile, is holding a closed-door meeting with chinese officials in beijing, and no details have been disclosed publicly. </seg>
<seg id="6"> this is the fifth formal meeting since china and the dalai government in exile restored their contact in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> but as usual, neither side has disclosed any details when holding the closed-door meeting. </seg>
<seg id="8"> a reporter said that both sides have held many talks, but have not made any substantial achievement so far. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the dalai lama, who is in exile in north india, said that he hopes that tibet will have autonomy instead of independence. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the chinese side refused to make any comment on the bilateral talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> but as analysts said, the reason why beijing hoped to have the bilateral talks is partially because it is worried that if the spiritual leader in exile dies, it might make tibetans unhappier about china's rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> cultural identification </seg>
<seg id="13"> the dalai government in exile delegation is led by lodi gyaltsen gyari, who was the chief delegate for several previous talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> a spokesman for the tibetan government in exile said that several talks held in switzerland between them and chinese officials in 2005 were very "close and frank," which brings hope to tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the spokesman said that they hope to eventually solve related issues with the chinese leadership based on the foundation established by negotiations, and let the tibetans have freedom, and maintain the cultural identification that they think is the most important thing. </seg>

<seg id="21"> it is expected that when the dalai lama visits the united states next week, he will discuss tibetan issues with president bush, and hope that bush could urge the chinese government to give tibet real autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> delegates of the dalai and officials from beijing had direct contact for the first time in bern in july of this year. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "a real autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> lodi gyaltsen gyari pointed out that both the tibetan government in exile and chinese authorities have seen some positive aspects from their talks in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the dalai lama's envoy discovered that leaders from beijing, especially those delegates of the central united front work department of the central committee of the chinese communist party, are more willing to listen to their views than they did before. </seg>
<seg id="26"> however, lodi gyaltsen gyari said that there are too many differences between the tibetan government in exile and the chinese government, and there is a big gap between the positions of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="27"> he said that in the past five years, the tibetan government in exile has done its best to create a good environment for negotiation requested by china, </seg>
<seg id="28"> and china should also create a good environment for negotiation of the tibetan issue, and should not suppress the dalai lama all the time. </seg>
<seg id="29"> he said that the dalai lama does not request tibetan independence, and tibet is still a part of china, but the chinese government must maintain the unique culture of tibet and "let tibetans have a real autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> lodi gyaltsen gyari also pointed out that some chinese think that as soon as the dalai lama passes away, the tibetan issue will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> he said that this view is very dangerous, because once the dalai lama is gone, china would lose the historical opportunity to solve the tibetan issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> he said that as long as the chinese government responds to the request raised by the dalai lama, and comes up with a final solution, the dalai lama would not need to talk about the tibetan issue internationally any more. </seg>

<seg id="1"> negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy! (zt) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> i just now saw a poster on "great decency -to old mr. guiren" sent by a network friend. </seg>
<seg id="4"> his (her) original words are that "negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy. otherwise, a split because of different views is a failure of democracy!!! hope that those ideal democrats pay fully attention to this!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> this plain and tasteless sentence, which has not attracted interest from any network friends, has made me imagine a lot and have many sorts of feelings. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at that moment i thought of the ancient times of china and the past of the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> i seldom sent the main poster. i cannot help but reply to the poster of the network friend in the way of the main poster. </seg>
<seg id="8"> let's see china's ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="9"> everyone knows that since qin shihuang established the universally unified and centralized power system in china, any subsequent dynasties were operated under the political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> although the han dynasty temporarily implemented a "two-track system," i.e. a political system that practiced the feudal system and centralized power system at the same time, it eventually switched to a complete centralized power system in the end. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the outcome of this kind of centralized power system had an advanced aspect in the historical condition by then, which promoted the development of productivity. </seg>
<seg id="12"> but we should also see that the long-term operation of the system for more than 2,000 years had made local administrations lacking of their creativities, initiatives, and enthusiasms, and unable to make various suitable systems and policies for local developments based on local circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="13"> the pyramid type of ruling system had made lower-class officials looking upward only and following directions from their superiors for everything. </seg>
<seg id="14"> there was no room for coordination and negotiation because even local officials at the county level were appointed by the central government, not to mention those common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> when rights of farmers were infringed upon in ancient china, they could only bear it time and again. </seg>
<seg id="16"> only when their basest rights were threatened, i.e. when a famine spread in big areas, a tyrannical rule or natural disaster caused loss of their living rights, would they rebel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> in more than 2,000 years, many peasant uprisings spread everywhere in the country like storms, but they never won a victory in a real sense except zhu yuanzhang, from chen sheng, and wu guang, who did not plan their uprising to the planned huang jin insurrection, from the huang chao revolt in the tang dynasty to the li zhicheng rebellion that established a dynasty for only a month. </seg>
<seg id="18"> even the ming dynasty created by zhu yuanzhang was only a cycle of other dynasties, and there were no systematic changes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> zhu yuanzhang, who came from a common family and did not receive much education, played the chinese ancient centralized power system to a sick extent, and to extremes. since then, the vigorous state of the type of the tang dynasty that was open, free, and tolerant, had become depressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the atmosphere of freedom of speech disappeared in the vast land of china for a time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> human nature was suppressed to the maximum extent. </seg>
<seg id="22"> everybody became very cautious and dared not to say more words with reverence and awe. </seg>
<seg id="23"> this was the only outcome of peasant uprisings in 2,000 years, and it made chinese people neither humans nor ghosts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> let's see the medieval ages of the so-called dark time in western europe. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the medieval ages of western europe were formed after the western rome was destroyed by nomadic nations, and lasted for a thousand years. they had nothing to do with the ancient greece and rome of the past. </seg>
<seg id="26"> those ages featured the feudal system, i.e. land holding. </seg>
<seg id="27"> many layers of land feudal lords, from the top to the bottom, had more autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="28"> no matter whether small feudal lords who had an area of several square kilometers, or nobles who had titles of duke, marquis, count, viscount, and baron, since superiors and inferiors, and the left and right, could balance, restrain, and were interdependent with each other, and had their prerequisites and capabilities to strive for their own rights against kings, the scenes in which nobles sat with a king negotiating for their own interest emerged, which never happened in china's ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="29"> compromises and concessions were made mutually instead use of violent means to knock down or replace opponents. </seg>
<seg id="30"> in this way, through making various contracts, rights were continuously transferred to nobles and common people, and they had more and more rights, and kings had fewer and fewer. </seg>
<seg id="31"> later, the british queen had only a status for display, and not any substantial power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> democracy was gradually realized in this way! </seg>
<seg id="33"> let's come back again to compare with ancient china, where every power was concentrated in the hands of emperors (except li shimin), and there were almost no nobles. it was very difficult for peasants to be able to sit in front of a negotiation table, joyfully making compromises and concessions on a contract agreed to by both sides while enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine. </seg>
<seg id="34"> under this circumstance, when the living right was taken away, only violent means could overthrow an existing dynasty and try to replace it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> its outcome was the repeated cycle from the peak of the tang dynasty to the sick status of the ming dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> comparing histories between china and the west, we discovered that the contradictions between rulers and the ruled in ancient china were much more intensified than those in ancient western countries. </seg>
<seg id="37"> no western countries had so many continuous peasant uprisings as ancient china had. </seg>
<seg id="38"> in the western countries, when differences between ancient royal families and peasants emerged, what nobles and common people thought of first was to settle them through a negotiation path, to obtain more rights gradually by making mutual concessions, and they seldom used violent means. </seg>
<seg id="39"> understanding this, when we enter into the 21st century, we can still see those democratic warriors in networks who have inherited the ideology of the absolute power concentration system of the ming dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and have been poisoned by the virus of the cultural revolution that they can say nothing except those words of "down with or overthrow something." </seg>
<seg id="41"> and those concepts are the biggest barrier to democracy, because those people do not understand that negotiation, coordination, and compromise are the most important means and path for realization of democracy. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> hou ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> the author was lucky to spend this year's spring festival in a rural area of the mainland, and visited some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> i was not only influenced by the dense atmosphere of the festival in the chinese rural area, but also concerned about those boring cultural activities there. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the author discovered in a village where my relatives lived that this village organized villagers spontaneously to play a drama called "trotting horse lamp" for every spring festival in the past. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the drama is based on figures in the story of the three kingdoms. any adult or child could play a role in the drama, and villagers were not bored at all to watch it a hundred times. </seg>
<seg id="7"> there were several of this kind of performance teams of "trotting horse lamp" in the whole township. they performed not only in their own villages, but also went to other villages for visits, and exchanged frequently. </seg>
<seg id="8"> but this village did not organize the performance this year. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the reason is that just the costumes for "trotting horse lamp" would cost a lot, which were bought in the past through donations from villagers. now they are too worn out to be taken on. </seg>
<seg id="10"> nobody was willing to donate any more, if asking villagers for donations household by household. other villages in the township had a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the village suddenly became quiet without the "trotting horse lamp." </seg>
<seg id="12"> adults started to play mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> children also began to play cards. </seg>
<seg id="14"> villagers said that this festival had no fun. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the big scene in the countryside is either shooting off fireworks or playing mahjong during the festival. </seg>
<seg id="16"> the gambling trend cannot be stopped even though it is prohibited time and again, and is spread even further. gambling for up to ten thousand yuan has become a routine game. especially, big batches of those migrant farmer workers who come back to their hometowns from other areas have played major roles in gambling sites. </seg>
<seg id="17"> their hard-earned money from working in other areas for a year is lost in this way. </seg>
<seg id="18"> family disputes occurred time and again because of gambling, which sometimes causes tragedies with families broken up and decimated. </seg>
<seg id="19"> some farmers said that they gambled not only during festivals but also participated in gambling frequently in slack seasons. </seg>
<seg id="20"> nowhere to go if they did not gamble. </seg>
<seg id="21"> it is too difficult to organize cultural activities and look for "fun" in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="22"> not only are there no facilities and funding, but also nobody organizes them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> but in this aspect, the practice in jiangxi is definitely good news for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> to enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses, the government of jiangxi province not only implemented the policy that "the government provides funding for it; the market operates it; townships build stages; and farmers watch dramas" last september, </seg>
<seg id="25"> but they also arranged at least 60 million yuan every year for the special fund for rural cultural causes and delivered good-quality cultural products to the rural masses. </seg>
<seg id="26"> in the beginning of this new year, it added an additional 40 million yuan, a total of 100 million yuan, for the establishment of special funding for the rural cultural cause. </seg>
<seg id="27"> and also, what this special funding "paid" toward the farmers' "bill" is quite a good deal: </seg>
<seg id="28"> various professional performance organizations are invited to have shows in rural areas, and provide at least four shows for every town each year. </seg>
<seg id="29"> movie companies at every level are invited to organize film projection teams to show movies in the countryside, and at least six feature or scientific education movies should be shown for every administrative village each year; </seg>
<seg id="30"> cultural activities with local features participated in by the masses are organized and developed at least two to three times for every township each year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> it is not difficult for us to see from the "purchase list" that the government does not simply pay the bill, but thinks hard how to use the limited funds in the critical area and deliver a cultural banquet that exceeds its money value to the farmer masses, and has done a big substantial thing for them. </seg>
<seg id="32"> now, a lot of farmers are very happy and joyful for immunity from providing "royal grains and state's tax." </seg>
<seg id="33"> if every government can pay the "bill" for enriching cultural activities of the farmer masses as jiangxi did, it would be another happy thing falling from the sky for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> and this "happy thing" can not only liberate farmers from the mahjong table, and make them "active" in cultural activities, but also add bricks and tiles for the construction of the new socialist countryside. </seg>

<seg id="5"> the child of wang peirong was called off by a gate guard when she was making up missed physics lessons at the third middle school of xuzhou on the morning of january 24, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the guard said to wang peirong's child that three unidentified men had told the gate guard at the third middle school that wang tianjiao, the child of wang peirong, had not gone back home for three days because of discord between her parents. </seg>
<seg id="7"> now her mother was missing, and they were leaders from her mother's work unit, and wanted to enter the third middle school and take away wang peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> wang peirong's child said: what the three men said was totally untrue. she refused to go with the three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> wang peirong's child was not taken away with the help of the gate guard of the third middle school. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wang peirong's child called one of her mother's leaders at noontime to confirm it. the leader denied that he had sent his men to visit the third middle school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> wang peirong's child obtained a phone number of one of her father's leaders from her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> wang peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> wang peirong's child said: three men visited the third middle school and wanted to take me away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the leader asked: why didn't you go with them? </seg>
<seg id="15"> wang peirong's child said: i would be dead for sure if i went with them. </seg>
<seg id="16"> wang peirong's child hung up the phone right away after she finished her words. </seg>
<seg id="17"> wang peirong felt that the case was serious after she listened to her child's description, and reported it to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the feedback from a public security station on january 25 was that wang peirong's child's description was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the public security station asked the security unit of kuangda if it had sent those men to look for wang peirong's child; the response was no. </seg>

<seg id="3"> on the 8th, a senior hamas official revealed to the associated press that hamas intends to nominate al-khudairi , board chairman of gaza's islamic university (and a merchant), as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but the nomination has not yet been formally delivered to abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> with the support of hamas, 50-year-old al-khudairi took part in the election of palestinian legislative council held last month in the capacity of independent candidate. </seg>

<seg id="1"> immediately following the decision by the international atomic energy agency (iaea) to refer the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council, iran has reiterated that ... eh ... there is no room for negotiations with the us, one of the promoters of the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2"> well ... an iranian government spokesman said on monday that the policy iran has maintained to date in regards to relations with the us is not to engage in discussion or negotiation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> he said the west has committed a grave error in referring the nuclear issue to the security council in an obvious attempt to block the development of iran. </seg>
<seg id="4"> iran said on monday that ... eh ... it would discontinue cooperation with iaea, resume the extraction of enriched uranium and prohibit spot checks of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> so, on this issue, iran's current attitude is pretty hard-line, ut the attitude of the united states is even more hard-line. </seg>
<seg id="6"> eh ... us defense secretary rumsfeld has repeatedly said that ... eh ... the use of force would not be ruled out in regard to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> well ... now there are rumors that the us military is putting such a plan into effect. </seg>
<seg id="8"> they are developing a super bomb, called the "mother of all bombs". </seg>
<seg id="9"> eh ... once the department of defense gives the go-ahead, this super bomb will be used to blast iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> so, how big exactly is this mother of all bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> it has been said that, in terms of weight alone, the bomb weighs 30,000 pounds, equal to the weight of a double-deck bus. also, its bulk is massive. </seg>
<seg id="12"> such a super bomb has been developed mainly to bombard certain underground facilities of iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> because of its massive penetrating power, it can penetrate concrete and also steel plate. it can roughly create a pit that is half a mile in radius and 60 feet deep, destroying several underground buildings and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> so it now seems that in this respect the us has really begun to hone its sword or make the bomb. </seg>
<seg id="15"> rumsfeld ... eh... said that, on this issue ... no means would be excluded as a solution to the iranian nuclear issue and a resort to force had been put on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> elsewhere, irrespective of the continuous escalation of the iranian nuclear issue, an iranian official in china said in an interview with this station that iran actually would still work with the international community by persisting in peaceful negotiation ... eh ... in the hope of easing the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> but he also added that iran would adjust the details of cooperation with russia on a nuclear project. </seg>
<seg id="18"> as for the second round of negotiations with russia regarding the enriched uranium cooperation project scheduled for february 16, the iranians said that the negotiations would go on as planned, though it was emphasized that the changes that have taken place so far will make it necessary to adjust the content of the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> russia has previously been a steady supporter of iran's peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and had said that it would remain stick to its position that the iranian nuclear issue should not be referred to the security council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> but, as we can see now, they have agreed to referring the iranian nuclear issue to the un security council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> given this new development, as a result we may make some changes to the policy we agreed on with russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> before the un security council ultimately decides in march whether to impose economic and political sanctions, iran will advocate continuous negotiations with related international organizations and, in the meantime, remains willing to cooperate with the international community to ease the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> we stress the point that, for purpose of its own economic growth and national construction, iran will not abandon the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> iran has not violated any related international laws. we hope that the united states too will understand this. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the iranian nuclear issue is completely different from the afghanistan and iraqi issues. </seg>
<seg id="26"> i think the us is pretty clear about that itself. </seg>
<seg id="27"> as for the so-called military strike, we haven't seen any clear-cut expression of attitude on the part of the united states. </seg>
<seg id="28"> we don't want to see the further escalation of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="29"> although we also make a point of using peaceful negotiation, we will not bow to pressure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> additionally, ((a ge bi)) also said that he hoped china would continue on the basis of its existing standpoint to cooperate with iran. </seg>

<seg id="1"> now let's look at some news items about japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> koizumi has been contemplating upgrading the japan defense agency to a ministry so as to build up japan's military muscle. </seg>
<seg id="3"> but, heated debates erupted during the process, which ran into one obstacle after another. </seg>
<seg id="4"> recently, a scandal surfaced involving tenders for engineering projects offered by the defense facilities administration agency, an institution under the defense agency. as a result, some former and current officials have been arrested by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> therefore, many people advised koizumi to be careful in his move to upgrade the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> and recently, koizumi said that he had temporarily put the plan on the shelf rather then refer it to the parliament for review. </seg>
<seg id="7"> and he also hopes that the two parties in power can discuss the issue carefully and, eh, continue their consultations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> elsewhere, here is some other news. if you go to japan, there is now a new rule. </seg>
<seg id="9"> that is, japan plans to, stipulates that most of tourists arriving in japan must have their fingerprints and photos taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the move aims to prevent some unsafe individuals from entering japan's borders and also prevent illegal immigration. </seg>
<seg id="11"> er, so, it will probably be more troublesome going to japan now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> of course, recently there was one good news in japan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> that is, princess kiko, wife of the second son of japanese emperor, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> this development has caused many japanese to hope that she will give birth to a boy who will be heir to the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> but, she also threw the imperial family, which has always stayed relatively quiet, into a commotion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> uh, in fact, kiko is now of course a mature pregnant mother and she has all along been thought to be content with a family of four. </seg>
<seg id="17"> being pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help conjecturing that, uh, a fraternal scramble for the throne may arise in the imperial household. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of course, many people are taking delight in talking about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> to explain this, one must go back to a few years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> eh, it's like this. at that time, in 2002, because the wife of crown prince naruhito, contracted depression, the imperial household did not place too much hope on them at the time and instead turned to the second prince, fumihito, whom they put pressure on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> at the time, fumihito did not do much in response. </seg>
<seg id="22"> but, by 2004, the contradiction intensified somewhat after naruhito, uh, out of his care for his wife, reproached the imperial family on public occasions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> it is said that the imperial family were furious and asked his peer, prince fumihito to stand out and rebut his elder brother, accusing him of showing disrespect for the imperial family and doting upon his wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> the brothers have been in discord from then on. </seg>
<seg id="25"> now, if prince fumihito gives birth to a boy, the dominant role they play will become a pillar of the imperial household </seg>
<seg id="26"> and the east palace, i.e. the crown prince will surely fall out of favor. </seg>
<seg id="27"> eh, this is why many people say that, if things go on like this, the impact on the imperial household and the japanese society will be tremendous. </seg>

<seg id="17"> he said the arms race between countries and the fight to achieve hegemony will not bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the hunger of the large superpowers will never be satisfied and they even go as far as to use nuclear weapons to threaten other countries. </seg>
<seg id="19"> but he said that the large superpower countries that rely on nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the day when mankind will have lasting peace and stability is close at hand. </seg>
<seg id="21"> so it can be seen that now, not only the war of words, but in actual truth, the sabre-rattling between iran and the west and between iran and the us has become more intense the longer it has gone on. </seg>
<seg id="22"> and because of the uncompromising attitude between iran and the us, recently there have been certain changes in the situation. that is, iran officially announced the day before yesterday that it would resume its plan to extract enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in fact, some western diplomats speculate that iran had actually already resumed certain processes in the extraction of enriched uranium prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in addition, iran also announced that it was postponing talks with russia for an indeterminate period of time. the talks were to deal with russia taking over the extraction of enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="25"> of course, the postponement for an unlimited duration of the plan to hold talks was also brought about by the new situation that currently exists. </seg>
<seg id="26"> and recently, because the us has continued to threaten that it will attack iran, the oxford research institute, a british think tank, issued a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> if the us actually employs military force, it will result in half the people being killed and furthermore would certainly spark a protracted wave of violence in the middle east. </seg>
<seg id="28"> also, terrorist attacks would also grow in intensity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the price of oil would without doubt also surge in what would be one part of a domino effect. </seg>
<seg id="30"> moreover, the report also says that if the us fails to subdue iran, it will result in iran resolving to move faster toward manufacturing its own nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="31"> we just spoke about the issue of talks between russia and iran. </seg>
<seg id="32"> in fact, a spokesman for the iranian government said on monday that because the situation had changed, iran would postpone talks with russian officials originally scheduled on the 16th regarding the extraction of enriched uranium inside russia's border. </seg>
<seg id="33"> a spokesman for the russian ministry of foreign affairs said: no official notice has yet been received from iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> it is therefore too early to say if the meeting will be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> furthermore, russia's federal atomic energy agency and the commissioner of energy resources [gu jinuofu] said on monday: russian has prepared for talks with iran on the nuclear issue and the conditions and principles for negotiation. </seg>

<seg id="2"> the title of the editorial was also very attention-grabbing. it was called japan's offensive foreign minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> the editorial highlighted the fact that japan's foreign minister, taro aso, has recently issued a string of shocking statements. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the statements were all extremely disingenuous and also extremely unwise, and they provoked widespread resentment in asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the editorial likewise made special note of the fact that the japanese should acknowledge their errors and learn their lesson, rather than, as is currently the case, avoiding mention in post-war educational material of the things they did during the war. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at the same time, the editorial also says that many of the opinions aired by taro aso, such as demanding that the prime minister pay homage at the yasukuni shrine and saying that colonial rule improved taiwan's, uh, that japanese colonial rule improved taiwan's educational standards, and so on, that he would make such statements shocked people, and, well, it is clear that he is bereft of any knowledge of history and that his diplomatic skills are also extremely poor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the new york times had the third largest circulation in the us last year. it can therefore be considered influential in us society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> so this editorial should also have quite an effect. </seg>
<seg id="9"> at the same time, some former senior officials in the us government as well as some specialists in asian issues have started a special discussion forum, that is, a discussion forum on sino-japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> in the discussion forum, some specialist put forth the following viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="11"> they said sino-japanese relations were currently in a very tense period and that there was a potential danger of armed  conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> moreover, they said that the possibility of armed conflict breaking out between china and japan was currently even greater than that of armed conflict over the taiwan strait. </seg>
<seg id="13"> uh, and once armed conflict breaks out, the us will definitely be dragged into it because the us is certain to become involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> a spokesman from japan's ministry of foreign affairs who also participated in the forum said that sino-japanese relations were in truth at a very tense stage currently. </seg>

<seg id="21"> the two military vehicles transporting grain and non-staple foods and belonging to the logistical system of the russian peacekeeping forces were inspected on monday night by georgian police in the south ossetia region of georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> let's take a look at some news items from  japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> recently, japan's political arena produced some rather sensational news. </seg>
<seg id="3"> that is, tsuneo watanabe, chairman of one of japan's leading papers, the yomiuri shimbun, he ordered yomiuri shimbun to publish some articles ...eh ... that oppose koizumi's visit to the yasukuni shrine, marking yomiuri shimbun's shift to a stand against koizumi's visit to yasukuni shrine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> eh ... so ... this tsuneo watanabe ..., in the speech he made a few days ago, he also lashed out at koizumi ..., saying that he is ignorant and has no historical and cultural knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="5"> at the same time, he commented that visiting yasukuni shrine was just like paying tribute to hitler and said that, in so doing, koizumi ... eh ... had caused china and south korea to ... eh ... regard japan as a very dangerous country. this will bring endless troubles. </seg>
<seg id="6"> so why has tsuneo watanabe's attitude caused such a  repercussion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> in fact, he is very influential in political circles and has always been a major behind-the-scenes operator. </seg>
<seg id="8"> and he used to be a very rightist figure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> it should be said that he has always been a supporter of the hawks and strongly advocated revision of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> but, now, ... well ... this is really a major turn-around. </seg>
<seg id="11"> he turned his gun and ... eh ... opened fire  on koizumi, adopting an attitude of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> actually, in 2004, when koizumi was being criticized for visiting yasukuni shrine, this tsuneo watanabe ... he ... eh ... he said that he supported it and wanted koizumi to withstand the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> recently, however, he made a speech, saying: "i am over 80 years old and don't have many days left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> so, he now stands up to make a high-profile speech with a very opposing attitude. </seg>
<seg id="15"> such a turnaround of course produced a significant impact on the entire japanese society. </seg>
<seg id="16"> just as tsuneo watanabe himself put it, he said: "i am convinced that i have the strength to control and change the direction of the political winds." </seg>
<seg id="17"> and he also said that he would put up a desperate resistance if the government pressured yomiuri shimbun with respect to its freedom of speech or its ability to interview. </seg>
<seg id="18"> so, what has the situation come to now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> well, japan's largest newspaper, yomiuri shimbun, and the second largest newspaper, asahi shimbu...eh, these two leading newspapers have started to team up in opposition to koizumi's visit to yasukuni shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> originally, the two papers were opponents, but after the two chairmen met, they were able to reach agreement on this issue at least. </seg>
<seg id="21"> therefore, they have now launched a campaign of considerable scale to criticize koizumi. you can say that they have formed an ideal combination. </seg>
<seg id="22"> actually, these two large newspapers have great sway over mainstream public opinion in japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in a separate development, let's look at the meeting of the japanese parliament. at a recent meeting, two candidates favored to succeed prime minister junichiro koizumi made the same type of remarks. </seg>
<seg id="24"> who were the two? </seg>
<seg id="25"> one was chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe and the other was minister for foreign affairs taro aso, who of late has frequently made astonishing remarks. </seg>
<seg id="26"> what did the two say? </seg>
<seg id="27"> they said that japanese war criminals of the second world war were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> what they mean is ... eh ... that, they claimed that these criminals ... it was the intention of the international court to convict them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> but, in japan, according to international laws ... they were citing the domestic laws of japan ... eh ... the war criminals ... did not break the domestic laws of japan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> so, they think that, in japan, world war ii criminals should not be regarded as criminals. </seg>
<seg id="31"> this shinzo abe ... he also mentioned that japan now ... eh ... should take the whole world into account, develop relations with the united states and develop commercial and trade relations with some east asian countries, and, furthermore, it should also try to develop closer ties with india rather than always focus on china. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster>  love life, love lu neng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> the china football association super league is set for some fierce battles. </seg>
<seg id="4"> luneng taishan is getting combat-ready for the new season with the championship in mind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> hot competitions will be triggered between the dalian, shandong and shanghai teams, the three strongest competitors for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in the end, who will win the championship? </seg>
<seg id="7"> based on an analysis of their strengths, taishan has a very good chance to become champion, but it is by no means a sure thing. </seg>
<seg id="8"> first of all, the new team members have not had long enough to get worked in. </seg>
<seg id="9"> taishan lost at four major events last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> this year, taishan recruited two players from the national team--li leilei and wang liang. with the addition of two foreign players soon afterwards, it is safe to say that the team will be stronger. </seg>
<seg id="11"> but because the national football team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq, there no way to say how well the two players from the national team will integrate. </seg>
<seg id="12"> by the time they return to the club, league matches will be set to begin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> that is why integration has become the most significant issue taishan is facing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> in my view, the national-team players can be used as backups in the first few rounds of league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> first, team integration can be achieved using the in-game training. </seg>
<seg id="16"> second, the national-team players who have just played group matches with the national team can use the lull to rest up. </seg>
<seg id="17"> after a few rounds, when the "knife is well sharpened', it will not be too late for them to play top spots. </seg>
<seg id="18"> in addition, the defense has some weaknesses. </seg>
<seg id="19"> last year, taishan's fans had some unfavorable things to say about the team's defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> this year, the defense will have improved with the recruitment of li leilei. but it's still not the time to sit back and relax. </seg>
<seg id="21"> there's still the problem of sluggish turnaround at the center back position, and the substitutes for this position are either too old or lacking in experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if performance at the center back position can be stabilized, taishan will gain some momentum on the road to becoming champion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in my opinion, they might as well use ren yongshun, who is strong physically. although he lacks experience, he should be put to work this year so as to be ready in the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in addition, gao yao can play center back as well. </seg>
<seg id="25"> taishan has quite a few players who can play defending midfield, such as cui peng and hai bing. </seg>
<seg id="26"> gao yao is physically very strong and a ferocious interceptor. he should be able to handle the center back position. </seg>
<seg id="27"> another question is whether the foreign recruits can adjust. </seg>
<seg id="28"> taishan has been plagued by problems with foreign recruits. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the performance of daniel [daniel danciulescu] last year was far from stellar. </seg>
<seg id="30"> we know that this year's selection of foreign players has not yet been finalized. </seg>
<seg id="31"> i think that apart from bringing in an excellent striker, a true left-footed midfielder should also be recruited this year. </seg>
<seg id="32"> except for xing rui, who played for the team a few years ago, taishan has not had a true left-footed player with good skills. </seg>
<seg id="33"> although players like cui peng and other can play the position, a truly competent left half back would be greatly preferred to fill-in. </seg>
<seg id="34"> if these three issues can be solved, taishan's road to the championship should be somewhat smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> as a shandong football fan, i'm really hoping taishan can win the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> but to be frank, with things looking like they do in the championships this year, taishan has a good chance, but it is far from a sure thing. </seg>

<seg id="3"> hello, everybody. </seg>
<seg id="4"> once again, the chinese new year has flown by and those who combined their vacation time with their new year's holiday are now returning to their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> we wish all our friends a happy new year, if it is not too late to say happy new year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> we spoke recently at a cafe with nplcn. he talked about present-day brandvista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the appearance of the website has improved greatly. </seg>
<seg id="8"> the content is well structured. </seg>
<seg id="9"> what pleases him most is the discuz-powered community bbs, which has undergone a thorough revamping. </seg>
<seg id="10"> in regards to the community, i must thank one person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> that is, mr. li mingshun, general manager of discuz beijing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> if you search for his name in google, you will get a slew of hits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> you probably know that he was previously with sina. he later started his own business, setting up an internet advertisement exchange platform for smes that was similar to the overseas website adbrite.com. </seg>
<seg id="14"> we discussed it with him at the time on msn. what he said, in general, was that: brandvista felt that the development of many industries in china depended on the expansion of the private economy and smes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> and currently, in the chinese market, this situation does not give reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="16"> so sme's in creative industries and similar services are unable to provide consultation to any significant extent. </seg>
<seg id="17"> collecting high fees to advance one's own development in the end leads to a discouraging cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> later, he came to discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> discuz is an outstanding forum program powered by php and mysql. </seg>
<seg id="20"> with the help of ramboo, a technical engineer from beijing, brandvista finally saw the light of day once again and hit the stage with matchless freshness. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the feedback was very good. </seg>
<seg id="22"> the interface was neat and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> it was also very fast. </seg>
<seg id="24"> with the neat interface, writing a few words that moved me and inspired others, exchanging tidbits about work and life with friends from the same industry that shared the same pursuits, i began to find that this was a pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="25"> thank you discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> recently, there has been a lot of news from the advertising industry. </seg>
<seg id="27"> starting in january, the wto system of openness in the ad industry began to be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="28"> large foreign companies have been arriving one after another. small foreign companies are sharpening their sword for battle. it seems to be a scene of prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> batey ads, which rose to prominence in singapore, has been having many difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> having lost a string of big clients and having suffered repeated setbacks in its development in mainland china, martin boase finally took a little time from a lawsuit in italy to think about shuffling things around. </seg>
<seg id="31"> batey ads will merge into jwt's network, keeping its own brandname and being managed by jwt. </seg>
<seg id="32"> however, at the same time, there were also rumors that bates and 141 network would merge into the ogilvy and mather system and be managed by the ogilvy and mather network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> even if 141 had already given its report to ogilvy and mather prior to that, having ted bates get payback against ogilvy and mather is also a interesting matter. </seg>
<seg id="34"> during the spring festival, several articles on the website were updated. we won't go into each one here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> everybody can go to the website to take a look when they have time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> at the same time, friends who still haven't entered the new forum can, with a few extra clicks of a mouse, enter into brandvista's completely new community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> you can get a feel for the environment, get to know the atmosphere and contribute a few words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> we hope you will find pleasure in finding the group. </seg>
<seg id="39"> we wish all friends a pleasant mood. </seg>
<seg id="40"> goodbye. </seg>

<seg id="3"> i saw this article and decided to share it with you; </seg>
<seg id="4"> this is not a momentary impulse, but rather a warm kindheartedness that has long existed in the heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> i asked myself what i would do if it were me. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the answer is very clear. i would way, "you have the wrong number" and hang up the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="7"> i've been thinking all this year about how one can actually help someone. </seg>
<seg id="8"> i have already given up on actions such as donating money or goods. </seg>
<seg id="9"> a couple days ago a friend said, "i already have no spare time to take care of myself. as for helping people, the heart is there by the means are not." </seg>
<seg id="10"> have a nice day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> a mother ten years in the past </seg>
<seg id="13"> it was a day ten years ago. the teacher was using the lunch break to nap at home, when suddenly the telephone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> she answered and heard an unfamiliar rough voice from the receiver: "your child stole a book and we caught her. come over right away!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> the crying of a little girl could also be heard though the receiver, as well as the sound of somebody nearby scolding her. </seg>
<seg id="16"> she turned her head to look at her only daughter watching the television and then immediately understood what was happening. </seg>
<seg id="17"> clearly, a little girl had been caught by a store clerk stealing a book and did not want her family to find out, so she dialed a number at random and happened to call there. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of course, she could hang up and forget about it, or even reprimand the party on the other line, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this affair had absolutely nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> but she was a teacher, and it could be that it was one of her students. </seg>
<seg id="21"> through the telephone, she could roughly imagine that the little girl who had made a mistake on the spur of the moment was surely terrified, since she was facing what could be life's most frightening circumstance. </seg>
<seg id="22"> after hesitating a moment, a thought suddenly came to her mind. yes, she would do it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> thereupon, after asking the bookstore's address, she rushed over there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> just as she had anticipated, standing in the bookstore was a little girl with a face full of tears. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the adults beside her were ferociously and loudly scolding her. </seg>
<seg id="26"> she instantly rushed forward and gathered the pitiful little girl into her arms, then turned toward the nearby store clerk and said: "whatever you have to say you can say to me. you shouldn't frighten children." </seg>
<seg id="27"> during the muttering of the somewhat unwilling store clerk, she paid the fine of less than one hundred yuan and then, with the little girl in hand, walked out of the store where she could see clearly the face overwhelmed by panic and tears. </seg>
<seg id="28"> she smiled and returned home with the little girl where she tidied her up without asking anything, then let the little girl leave, </seg>
<seg id="29"> as the little girl was about to go, she also made a point of urging, "if you want to read a book, then come here to auntie's house. there are lots of books here.' </seg>
<seg id="30"> the still badly shaken little girl looked are her deeply for a moment, then dashed off, after which she never came back. </seg>
<seg id="31"> time rushed by like running water. imperceptibly, ten years went by in a flash. </seg>
<seg id="32"> she had forgotten the incident, still living there as before, she led a calm and peaceful life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> one afternoon, there was a knocking on the outside door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> opening the door to her apartment, she saw a pretty young woman she did not know. the girl was smiling broadly and in her hands she held a stack of presents. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked with uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="37"> the young girl excitedly gave a long explanation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> to her surprise, from the unfamiliar young lady's story she suddenly realized that the young woman was actually the little girl from that year. ten years later, she had graduated from university without difficulty and had now come especially to call on her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> the young woman's eyes glistened with tears as she said in a gentle voice: "although i still don't understand even today why you were willing to pass yourself off as my mother and come to my rescue, but for the last ten years i had a constant feeling that i wanted to cry out 'mother' to you." </seg>
<seg id="40"> the teacher's eyes started to cloud over as well. </seg>
<seg id="41"> somewhat curious, she asked: "if i hadn't helped you that day, what would have been the result?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> the young woman's face instantly darkened and she lightly shook her head, saying: "i'm not sure. maybe i would have gone on doing stupid things, or i might even have died." </seg>
<seg id="43"> a violent shiver went through the teacher's heart, then she rejoiced to  herself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> the impetuous decision that she had made back then had unexpectedly had such an influence on a person's entire life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> looking at the happy smile on the young woman's face, she also began to smile. </seg>

<seg id="49"> human nature is good at the outset. </seg>
<seg id="50"> everybody has a compassionate heart. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <headline> military observation: how long can iran hold out under us air attacks? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster>  yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> if we describe conventional war of attrition as causing the opponent to bleed to death, then from the outset modern warfare consists of shooting a gun toward the opponent's head in order to render him a "vegetable" even before there is time to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the disparity between the military capabilities of iran and the us is not one of quantity, but rather in the understanding of modern war. </seg>
<seg id="5"> iran, which fought a victorless eight-year war with iraq, seems not yet to have understood the true significance of modern hi-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> following an analysis of us military deployments, britain's "international intelligence--commentary" recently said that the us military is carrying out preparations to launch a large scale air assault on iran...... </seg>
<seg id="7"> the current status of iran's air force is cause for concern. </seg>
<seg id="8"> the present situation of iran's air force is quite similar to that of iraq's air force prior to the 2003 war. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the country does not possess the capacity to research and develop modern weapons on its own and is also under an arms embargo imposed by the west. </seg>
<seg id="10"> once war breaks out, it is uncertain whether the antiquated planes in iran's air force will be able to take to the air to engage us forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> at present, iran's air-defense system consists primarily of an air force belonging to iran's regular forces, the land-based air-defense force and the air-defense capacity of the revolutionary guard. </seg>
<seg id="12"> of these, iran's air force presently has a manpower of 50,000 and more than 300 aircraft of various models. </seg>
<seg id="13"> the most important aircraft models include us-manufactured f-4 phantoms, f5 tigers, f-14 tomcats and russian-manufactured mig-29s. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the land-based air-defense force is primarily equipped with surface-to-air missiles of the us-manufactured hawk series and the british rapier series, as well as a portion belong to the russian-manufactured sam series. </seg>
<seg id="15"> with regards to the current status of iran's air-defense strength,  analysis by individuals such as the us military expert harold hutchison and  military expert [hela muqixin] of the [russian political and military research institute] indicates that, viewed from the present situation, there are still holes in iran's air-defense capabilities and air-defense system. </seg>
<seg id="16"> hutchison says that with respect to overall capabilities, iran's air force simply is not on the same level as the us air force. </seg>
<seg id="17"> a large number of the us-manufactured jetfighters that iran is equipped with cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and upgrading. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the f-14 fighter was once the trump card of iran's air force, but today there are only ten or so that are able to fly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the dependability in actual combat of the aim-54 phoenix missiles they carry, known for their ultra-long distance attack capabilities, is also doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="20"> [hela muqixin] points out however that the air-defense missile systems provided to iran by the us in the 1970s and 1980s have lost their warfare capabilities because of a lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> in addition, the other non-systematic air-defense weapons obtained from russia and other countries are simply incapable of countering us forces possessing powerful electromagnetic countermeasure capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="22"> scraping together a military affects battle capability </seg>
<seg id="23"> clearly, iran's government is also aware that its fate in a conflict depends upon whether it can defend the sky above and it has been carrying out eleventh-hour preparations by scraping together whatever it can find in order to build up its air-defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> at present, its methods can be summarized into two devices: </seg>
<seg id="25"> the first is an all-out effort to conceal key nuclear facilities and beef up their defense capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to a report in the british newspaper the times, iran has hidden the natanz nuclear facility, the isfahan uranium enrichment center and other core components of their nuclear facilities eighteen meters underground and added a two-meter thick concrete protection shell. </seg>
<seg id="27"> but the us military is one step ahead. as early as the 1991 persian gulf war, it saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in anti-aircraft defense and rushed to develop various types of earth-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> after ten years of focused research, the us military has a full complement of strategies and weapons to counter reinforced underground bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> iran has recently also bought a large amount of advanced air-defense weapons from russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> since the end of last year, iran's government has reached a series of agreements with russia to purchase pechora-2a air defense missile systems as well as 29 tor-m1 air-defense missile systems valued at us$700m. </seg>
<seg id="31"> however, modern warfare is a contest of system against system. </seg>
<seg id="32"> the various air-attack weapons of the us military have all been developed by the country itself for its own benefit and, through many years of perfectioning in actual combat, they have been molded into an impressive war machine. </seg>
<seg id="33"> on the other hand, iran's "up-to-date weapons" have been scraped together from other countries. whether or not they can be made combat effective in such a short time is still in question. </seg>
<seg id="34"> iran's lags behind not only in weapons </seg>
<seg id="35"> the concept of "air-land battle" was first raised in "operations", published by the us military in 1982. it stresses reliance on strength in the air to carry out attacks against the enemy's strategically valuable targets. this paralyses the other side's command systems at the start of the war and turns the enemy's conventional forces, even if they are superior, into a "slab of meat on a cutting board." </seg>
<seg id="36"> in the 1991 persian gulf war, the 1999 kosovo war and the 2003 iraq war, the us military did not concern itself with how many planes the opponent had, but rather the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> even if iran's government has prepared for a possible air attack and has begun to take steps to reinforce its air-defense capabilities, iran, which fought to a stalemate in an eight-year war with iraq, seems not to have fully understood the true meaning of modern hi-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> with the progress of the us military's military transformation in recent years, the us military's air-attack operations are completely different from the carpet bombing of the vietnam war and instead rely on full-depth air assaults with various hi-tech weapons and modern information technology. </seg>
<seg id="39"> faced with this kind of air assault, how long iran's land-based air defense systems can hold out is an unknown. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <headline> joining hands with google to battle microsoft: will dell charge microsoft "top-shelf fees"? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster>  yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> dell inc. (us: dell) and google confirmed on tuesday that dell is currently testing pcs installed with google's software pack. </seg>
<seg id="4"> this step could form a significant threat to microsoft's (microsoftcorp., msft) dominant position in the pc software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> dell spokesman jess blackburn said the company is currently evaluating google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> after the software has been installed, the pc-user will be able to use the software to conduct searches on the internet as well as search through information stored on the pc. </seg>
<seg id="7"> blackburn confirmed that the software being evaluated by the company includes a google-supported dell homepage, a google desktop search tool and a google tool bar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> at the same time, google spokesman jon murchinson also confirmed that the company was working with dell in testing a software bundle developed by google. </seg>
<seg id="9"> earlier, a report in the wall street journal had said that it upstart google was in talks with dell and hewlett-packard in an attempt to convince the computer manufacturing giants to install google software in their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> according to an insider quoted by the wall street journal, in order to achieve this end, google may have to pay up to us$3bn over the next three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, the two companies have not disclosed any relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> furthermore, hp still refuses to issue a comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> microsoft spokesman neil charney refused to comment on the above information. </seg>
<seg id="14"> currently, microsoft is planning to launch a search tool for the next generation of its windows operating system and strengthen the development of its online business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> on the day of the news statement, shares in google fell another 4.46% to us$367.92. </seg>
<seg id="16"> shares in microsoft fell that day by 1% to close at us$26.94. </seg>
<seg id="17"> some analysts say that google is eagerly seeking to expand in a direction beyond web searching and that linking up with dell and other pc giants could prompt google to threaten microsoft in its core businesses. </seg>
<seg id="18"> matt rosoff, analyst with the market research firm directions on microsoft, says that microsoft is unquestionably concerned and worried by google's eagerness to expand into other sources of revenue. </seg>
<seg id="19"> but other analysts strongly disagree. </seg>
<seg id="20"> charles di bona, analyst with market research firm sanford c. bernstein, says that it is still too early to talk about google shaking windows' dominate position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> reporter handbook: is google shaking up microsoft's landscape? </seg>
<seg id="22"> hui zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> without doubt, the computer has become a necessity in modern man's life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> but while everybody has become familiar with operating computers, only a small portion of people understand the working principles behind a computer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> just like with an "idiot" camera, if the interface is friendly and the software is convenient and quick to use, the vast majority of "newbies" can find their way around the black box that is a computer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> for this reason, the software originally installed by the pc manufacturer more often than not determines the usage habits of most consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> indeed, it was through this measure that microsoft took firm hold of the market for pc operating systems. </seg>
<seg id="28"> now, microsoft's new rival, google, also intends to use this method to take a piece of the pie. </seg>
<seg id="29"> in regards to this, a well-known organization in the taiwanese economic media recently made an interesting analogy. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "dell, hp and other computer manufacturers are starting to treat the computers they produce as supermarket shelves and they are charging 'top shelf fees' to software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> the winning bidder can cause its software to appear in the 'crucial ten minutes' after the user turns on the new computer and thereby induce the consumer to use their product. </seg>
<seg id="32"> this type of fee method is like the top-shelve fees charged by supermarkets to food companies." </seg>
<seg id="33"> without doubt, this phenomenon indicates that microsoft's control is being shaken. </seg>
<seg id="34"> microsoft's managers have warned bill gates, saying that if google starts paying money to pc manufacturers in order to have computers shipped with google software installed, then microsoft's position as overlord will ultimately be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> whatever the final outcome, microsoft's easy days safely perched at the top of the ladder might become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> after all, keeping a market is much more difficult than creating a market銆</seg>

<seg id="3"> the sword of righteousness: outlook for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> author: sword of righteousness </seg>
<seg id="5"> i remember that at the beginning of 2005 hong kong's apple daily carried an article titled "falun rotates continuously and its gong may be able to defeat a regime". </seg>
<seg id="6"> the article states that 2004 was a year in which falun gong advanced triumphantly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the article lists examples of various occasions and situations where suppression of the falun gong movement by mainland china's overseas officials failed and relates how falun gong practitioners speaking the truth around the world have caused mainland china to completely lose face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> but 2004 doesn't seem to have been anything special when compared to the powerful momentum of 2005's withdraw-from-the-party movement, which was caused by the book nine commentaries on the communist party. </seg>
<seg id="9"> so, what will 2006 bring? </seg>
<seg id="10"> we can probably get a hint of how this year will develop from two events that occurred at the start of the year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> one was the publication of "on eliminating evil" by the creator of falun gong. the article pronounced that, following july 20, 1999, the final days of mainland china's secret agents were nigh. </seg>
<seg id="12"> as for this article, many people may half believe it or disbelieve it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> but regardless of whether it is believed or not, history and facts will prove it! </seg>
<seg id="14"> of course, the chinese communist party's secret agents are like rats that live in the sewers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> their "natural or accidental" death will not attract the attention of society and public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> but the large scale striking down or repentance of the ccp's overseas secret agents will inevitably deliver a heavy blow and a great shock to the power-wielding strata of the ccp. </seg>
<seg id="17"> frightened by the awe-inspiring threat of being struck down, they have no choice but to carefully consider their own means of escape and survival---withdrawing from the party, defecting and fighting against the ccp. </seg>
<seg id="18"> for this reason, the ccp's "ultra-stable bureaucratic organization", held together by squalid self interest, will start to move toward shakiness, disintegration and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> another event was the human-rights hunger-strike protest movement launched by gao zhisheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> it erupted suddenly and initially wasn't well-regarded, but it unexpectedly received an enthusiastic response from around the world as well as a collective response from people from all walks of life and various influential bodies. </seg>
<seg id="21"> if this movement can become a bond bringing together the suffering people and various influential bodies fighting for justice, and can be made stronger, then there might be hope that the outside force that deals the final blow to  the ccp, an evil regime in a very precarious situation, may take shape from here. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if it can be said that 2005 was the year that the communist party was destroyed at the spiritual level, then in 2006 things will have entered into the stage where the communist party is destroyed at the spiritual and material level. </seg>
<seg id="23"> following further dissemination of the nine commentaries and growth in the wave of withdrawals from the party, the disintegration of the ccp and the consolidation of external forces fighting for justice, the countdown has begun for the end of the lifespan of the fiendish ccp! </seg>
<seg id="24"> the will of heaven and the will of the people have merged. the strength of the spirits and the strength of man are joining together. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the heavenly sword is pointing straight at the demon ccp! </seg>
<seg id="26"> if it can be said that 2004 was a year of marching forward in militant song and 2005 was a year of moving forward with great momentum, then what will be the closing assessment of  2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope it is an earthshaking radical change and triumphant return in victory! </seg>

<seg id="5"> title: xu zhiyong: a letter to li qun, party secretary of the linyi cpc municipal committee--by using hooligan tactics, you will harm yourselves too. </seg>
<seg id="6"> website of origin: yjrg.net (wed feb 8 13:56:14 2006), current website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> as of yesterday, the government of linyi, of which you are the leader, has held chen guangcheng under illegal house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> you have joined with hooligan and gangland elements to illegally imprison a law-abiding citizen who is completely blind. </seg>
<seg id="9"> you have cut his home's telephone line and installed mobile phone interrupters in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> on several occasions, you have also beat him or members of his family. </seg>
<seg id="11"> your barbaric acts have transgressed the lowest limits of civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> at the beginning of october, 2005, you employed hooligan gangland tactics to beat the lawyer li fangping and myself, but we have been patient and have always done our best to understand the difficult situation you are in. for a period of time, we even tolerated that you had placed chen guangcheng under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="13"> but 165 days have gone by and you still haven't restrained yourselves. on the contrary, you have intensified your efforts. </seg>
<seg id="14"> you have dispatched large contingents of police and thugs to harass the villagers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> you have continued to arrest and beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> you have gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> today, as you continue to organize underworld thugs to surround chen guangcheng, we clearly warn you that thuggish underworld tactics will in turn come back to hurt you. </seg>
<seg id="18"> you need to rethink this affair from its beginning. </seg>
<seg id="19"> province wide, linyi ranks last in planned parenthood. </seg>
<seg id="20"> as municipal party secretary, it is understandable that you are somewhat anxious. </seg>
<seg id="21"> but you are mistaken in your belief that the people of linyi are of such low upbringing that it is necessary to use violence and coercion to implement state laws and policies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if citizens do not act in concert with the actions of government, in the end whose fault is it? </seg>
<seg id="23"> is it because the citizens are of low upbringing or is it because for a long time the government has engaged in so much lying and deception that its public credibility is too low? </seg>
<seg id="24"> assuming that ten years ago the same type of actions by government didn't seem so outrageous, don't you feel that, in 2005, when chinese society has made clear progress and human-rights guarantees have been written into the constitution, your savage acts seem ludicrous? </seg>
<seg id="25"> think about it for a moment. how is it that only you people in linyi dare to act this way? </seg>
<seg id="26"> how is it that only you people in linyi are unable to enforce the law using democratic and legal methods? </seg>
<seg id="27"> in the wake of the reports by chen guangcheng and other courageous citizens regarding the savage enforcement of laws, the brave intercedence by teng biao and other legal personnel to protect the rights of citizens, as well as the conclusions drawn from the investigation by the state family planning commission, the city of linyi could have, in good faith, offered an explanation and reached a compromise with the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> when all is said and done, family planning is a difficult problem that is specific to china. </seg>
<seg id="29"> likewise, we can all empathize with the difficult situation you are in. </seg>
<seg id="30"> but you nevertheless went on to employ outrageous measures--arresting chen guangcheng and bringing him back from beijing to be held prisoner, then attempting to have him found guilty of illegally revealing state secrets. </seg>
<seg id="31"> don't you find it quite ludicrous to accuse a blind man from a poor mountain village of that crime? </seg>
<seg id="32"> actually, if you had truly corrected your errors, if you had acted correctly, would you fear the criticism of a blind man? </seg>
<seg id="33"> did you have to send several dozen people to keep watch over him twenty-four hours a day and, flustered and exasperated, even have him accused of a crime? </seg>
<seg id="34"> on october 4, 2005, attorney li fangping and i arrived in dong shigu village. we put forth a very clear position in the hope of resolving the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="35"> we suggested that we could first talk with your officials to see what thoughts and demands you had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> we took the initiative of suggesting that we could help you persuade chen guangcheng that there are some things he should not say. </seg>
<seg id="37"> we hoped that you would not treat a blind person in such a manner. there should be concessions from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="38"> but your decision-makers clung obstinately to their course. furthermore, you unexpectedly came up with a "careful plan"--beating us and detaining us illegally. </seg>
<seg id="39"> do you think you can intimidate us in this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> we haven't done anything illegal, </seg>
<seg id="41"> so we have nothing to fear. </seg>
<seg id="42"> although the rule of law in china may not be perfect, but neither is it at the point of lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="43"> if you think you can use thuggish tactics to intimidate us, then you have greatly underestimated our determination and perseverance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> if we want, there are many of us with abundant legal justifications to go to linyi or visit chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> you can beat a lawyer or an academic once, twice, three times, and each time there will be widespread attention and reporting. </seg>
<seg id="46"> do you really dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> isn't it your official position that you are so worried about? </seg>
<seg id="48"> if the beatings actually result in somebody being injured, will your position be so assured? </seg>
<seg id="49"> you don't listen to our rational advice, but instead resort to low-class ruffian tactics. don't you find this very foolish and also very dangerous? </seg>
<seg id="50"> i want to make it clear to you that there is a large group of outstanding citizens in china that are devoted to the just adherence to the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="51"> we are not afraid of ruffian criminal elements. </seg>
<seg id="52"> we will not tolerate the brazen trampling of the lowest limits of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> if you go too far, we will confidently and calmly step forward, group after group, to welcome your clubs until the moment that you shrink back. </seg>
<seg id="54"> you should understand clearly that the use of hooligan tactics is in no way a good thing for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> don't think that after you retreat behind the scenes you will be able to break off your involvement with those local ruffians that beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> finally, we also want to remind you that you should treat chen guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> blind since childhood, he graduated from collegial studies in chinese medicine and then taught himself law and english. in the past, he brought legal action against the beijing subway company in order to fight for the rights of blind people and also had running water installed for the villagers. he has become known near and far as "attorney chen". </seg>
<seg id="58"> you have unexpectedly mobilized unabashed flunkies to spread rumors and slander him on the internet and have attempted to have him sentenced with the crime of illegally providing secrets to foreigners. don't you think that in doing so you have gone too far? </seg>
<seg id="59"> your house arrest of chen guangcheng is illegal. it is also dangerous for you yourself. </seg>
<seg id="60"> at first, you were fully capable of releasing him. </seg>
<seg id="61"> inasmuch as the savage enforcement of the law had already ceased, he could criticize all he wanted, but how long would he go on? </seg>
<seg id="62"> but you are now steadily denigrating your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> until cheng guangcheng obtains his freedom, you will not have a day of peace. </seg>
<seg id="64"> you have persecuted him enough. </seg>
<seg id="65"> if you try to have him convicted of a crime or attempt to use further thuggish tactics, we will not fold our arms and stand by. </seg>

<seg id="2"> <poster>  explore the road to the peaceful liberation of china and advance the spiritual emancipation of the countrymen. </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> with great disappointment, i admit that the chinese nation does not deserve democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> isn't this what the people posting articles here have been doing? </seg>
<seg id="5"> the pity is that there won't be many people (compared to a population of 1.4 billion) coming online to read them. </seg>
<seg id="6"> and there are even fewer people among the web surfers who care about or take part in such topics. i dare say, less than 1% of them! </seg>
<seg id="7"> let alone the fact that this network is protected by the golden shield project, which is the largest, most complete, most invested and best quality system in the world! </seg>
<seg id="8"> indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> i agonized, despaired, felt helpless and even thought of succumbing. but if we want to lead a life fit for humans, who can we count on to fight but ourselves? </seg>
<seg id="10"> man proposes and god disposes. yet even if i failed, i would hold myself to blame and deserve the life of a dog if i did not struggle for my own ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> to struggle for something just in itself adds happiness to one's life, at least in terms of one's self-judgment in one's own heart. </seg>
<seg id="12"> actually, i have absolutely no need to worry about the future of china, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the global environment is already such that it will not permit the existence of a regime that has failed to hold elections for so long. </seg>
<seg id="14"> it is merely a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> i just sigh that the chinese nation could have been so lucky that, at every turn of history, it could always be led by world-class demons onto a marrow-and-blood-sucking road to hell. some people actually call the heaps of white bones and pools of blood on this road glory and force us to feel proud of such glory. </seg>
<seg id="16"> although darkness exists everywhere, it is at its longest in china. </seg>
<seg id="17"> qin shi huang and confucius caused the people to suffer so much. </seg>
<seg id="18"> while qin shi huang persecuted openly, confucius brainwashed under the table. </seg>
<seg id="19"> it's not that the chinese do not deserve democracy. it's that they no longer have democracy in their genes, which have all degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> a country with a history of over 3,000 years would have become democratic long ago if its national culture had a component for democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> what were the chinese doing when athens established its democratic system, when rome founded the republic, when the british adopted their charter, when the french issued the declaration of human rights and when the americans published the declaration of independence? </seg>
<seg id="22"> before mongolians invaded the central plains, they elected their monarch through the kuraltai. in their early days, manchurians practiced a democratic system of ministerial meetings. why did all these fizzle out in the han regions? </seg>
<seg id="23"> chinese chase material goods and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual belief and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> you don't believe it? if the chinese were given universal suffrage, they would sell it to you for a single pie. </seg>
<seg id="25"> five hundred thousand years later, it would need an earthquake for the chinese to want democracy. so run while you can! </seg>

<seg id="4"> dalai lama stressed he wants autonomy, not independence, for tibet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> envoys of tibet's exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama are in china for closed door talks with chinese officials. details have not yet been released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> this is the fifth official meeting since china and the dalai lama's exiled government resumed contacts in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> but, as in the past, the two sides are meeting behind closed doors. no details have yet been disclosed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> reporters say the two sides have held talks on several occasions, but so far there have been no tangible results. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the dalai lama, who is in exile in northern india, says he wants autonomy, not independence, for tibet銆</seg>
<seg id="10"> china has refused to comment on the talks between the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="11"> but analysts say beijing wants dialogue, partly because it fears the death of the 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile could lead to heightened sentiments among tibetans unhappy with china rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> cultural identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> the delegation from the dalai lama's exiled government is led by lodi gyaltsen gyari. he was also the lead delegate in earlier talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> a spokesman for the tibetan government-in-exile said the round of talks that they had with chinese officials in switzerland in 2005 were very "intensive and frank" and this has given the tibetan people hope. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the spokesman said their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis of a negotiated settlement with the chinese leadership so that the tibetan people will have the freedom to preserve what is important to them, which is their cultural identity. </seg>

<seg id="17"> dalai lama's envoy reiterates tibetan independence is not being sought </seg>
<seg id="18"> dalai lama to visit washington this month </seg>
<seg id="19"> in the run-up to the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama's trip to the us on november 8, his envoy has said that the tibetan government-in-exile is not seeking tibet's independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> lodi gyaltsen gyari said in washington that he hopes that the chinese government will truly protect tibet's unique culture and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="21"> it is expected that during his visit to the us next week the dalai lama will discuss the tibet issue with president bush in the hope that bush will press the chinese government to give tibet genuine autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> in july of this year, envoys of the dalai lama's met with beijing's officials in berne for their first direct contact. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "genuine autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> lodi gyaltsen gyari said that in recent years talks between the tibetan government-in-exile and the chinese authorities has revealed some positive elements. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the envoys of the dalai lama found that the leaders in beijing, particularly the delegates of the ccp's united front work department, are more willing than in the past to listen to their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> but lodi gyaltsen gyari said the tibetan government-in-exile and the chinese government still have several differences of opinion and are still far-apart in their standpoints. </seg>
<seg id="27"> he said that in the last five years the tibetan government-in-exile has done its utmost to respond to china's demands in order to create a favorable negotiating environment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> in order to create a favorable negotiating environment on the tibetan issue, china should refrain from blindly pressuring the dalai lama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> he said the dalai lama does not seek independence for tibet and that tibet is still a part of china, but that the chinese government must protect tibet's unique culture and "allow the tibetan people genuine autonomy". </seg>
<seg id="30"> furthermore, lodi gyaltsen gyari said that some chinese people think that once the dalai lama has died the tibet issue will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> he said that this thinking is extremely dangerous because once the dalai lama is dead china will have lost a historic opportunity to solve the tibet issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> he said that the chinese government only needs to respond to the dalai lama's demands and suggest a final means of resolution, then the dalai lama will no longer need to talk at the international level about the tibet issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <headline> the key tools of democracy: negotiation and compromise!(zt) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster>  hou ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> i've just read a web friend's posting in "awe-inspiring righteousness--mr. li guiren" </seg>
<seg id="4"> his (her) original words were "negotiation and compromise are key tools of democracy. otherwise, divisions due to differences of opinion result in the failure of democracy!!! it is hoped that idealistic democracy advocates will pay close attention to this point!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> that this prosaic and colorless statement did not attract the interest of any web friends stired a succession of thoughts in my mind and filled me with regret. </seg>
<seg id="6"> i think about china's antiquity. i also think about the past in the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> i, who have started very few threads, could not resist using a new thread to respond to the posting by the original net friend. </seg>
<seg id="8"> let's first take a look at antiquity in china. </seg>
<seg id="9"> everybody knows that in china, starting with the united centralized rule built by qin shi huang, all subsequent dynasties operated according to this political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> although the han dynasty temporarily implemented a "dual system"; that is, political system in which feudalism and centralism operated in parallel; it finally ended up employing centralism. </seg>
<seg id="11"> under the historical conditions of that time, this kind of centralism had facets that were advanced or that promoted productivity and development. </seg>
<seg id="12"> but we should also observe that more than two thousand years of this kind of system resulted in localities that lacked the creativity, initiative and motivation that they should have. furthermore, it was impossible to tailor-make systems and policies so that they suited local development. </seg>
<seg id="13"> a pyramid-shaped system of political rule also made it so that lower-level officials could only fix their gazes upward and in every regard take orders from their immediate superiors. </seg>
<seg id="14"> because the local county officials were all appointed by the central government, there was no room for coordination or negotiation between them, let alone with the common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> when the rights of peasants in ancient china were infringed upon, they could only grin and bear it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> it was only when their most basic rights were threatened, such as by large scale famine, or when their right to life was being deprived due to tyranny or natural calamity, that they would rise in rebellion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> in two thousand years, several turbulent peasant uprisings have swept across the entire country: from the unplanned chen sheng and wu guang uprising to the preplanned yellow turban rebellion, and then to the huang chao rebellion in the tang dynasty and li zicheng, who was able to rule as emperor for a month as the result of an uprising. besides zhu yuanzhang, none of the rebellions obtained a truly meaningful victory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> even the ming dynasty that zhu yuanzhang initiated was nothing more than the reincarnation of previous dynasties, with no change in political institutions. </seg>
<seg id="19"> zhu yuanzhang, born a commoner and uncultured for the most part, manipulated china's ancient centralized system with a perverse relish, taking it to its extreme limits. the vigor of the tang dynasty, characterized by openness, freedom and tolerance, was lost and replaced by a deathly spiritlessness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> all at once, the atmosphere of free speech disappeared from china's vast area. </seg>
<seg id="21"> human nature was suppressed to the highest degree. </seg>
<seg id="22"> people became timorous, extremely afraid, and unwilling to say too much. </seg>
<seg id="23"> this was the outcome of the only peasant uprising to succeed in two thousand years: in one go it turned the chinese people into the living dead. </seg>
<seg id="24"> now let's look at western europe's medieval period, which has been called the dark ages. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the middle ages in western europe was a thousand year period that occurred after nomadic peoples destroyed western rome and that did not have the slightest connection to ancient greece and ancient rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> this period was characterized by feudalism; that is, the granting of feudal land titles. </seg>
<seg id="27"> as titles were subdivided into increasingly lower strata, the lords at each lower stratum possessed an increased amount of autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="28"> because they were capable of balancing, restricting and depending on each other both vertically and horizontally, even feudal lords with a few square kilometers of land as well as the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons that came to power possessed the conditions and clout to win from the king the rights that were rightfully theirs, thereby producing a situation where aristocrats and the king sat together to negotiate for their respective benefit, a situation that has never existed in china. </seg>
<seg id="29"> that is, mutual accommodation and concession, and not the use of violent methods to beat down and replace the other party. </seg>
<seg id="30"> in this way, with the drawing up various agreements, power steadily moved down into the hands of aristocrats and commoners. the power of the aristocrats and commoners gradually increased while the king's power progressively decreased. </seg>
<seg id="31"> by the time the queen of england came along, she only occupied a passive position and did not have any real power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> this is how democracy was gradually achieved! </seg>
<seg id="33"> let's take another look back in order to make a comparison. in ancient china, with all power concentrated in the hand of the emperor (with the exception of li shimin) and almost no aristocracy, it was almost impossible for peasants to sit with the emperor over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and light-heartedly make mutual compromises and concessions or formulate agreements that satisfied both sides. </seg>
<seg id="34"> under such circumstances, when they were being deprived of their right to life, they had no choice but to adopt violent methods to overthrow the current dynasty in an attempt to supplant it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> this outcome repeated itself again and again, from the high point of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the ming dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> if we compare european and chinese history, we discover that there is practically no western country with an ancient period where the contradictions between the rulers and the ruled were as sharp as in china. </seg>
<seg id="37"> there is no western country that experienced an endless succession of peasant uprisings like china did. </seg>
<seg id="38"> when contradictions arose between the royal house and the peasants in the ancient history of western countries, the first thing that aristocrats and commoners thought of when they were making an appeal for their own interests was to reach a solution through negotiation and make mutual concessions in order to gradually obtain greater benefits. rarely did they employ violent methods. </seg>
<seg id="39"> understanding this, as we enter the 21st century, we can still see on the internet that there are some democracy militants who, having inherited the ultra-absolute totalitarian thinking of the ming dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and whose bodies have been invaded by the poison of the cultural revolution, are incapable as democratic warriors of talking about anything but "overthrow" and "toppling". </seg>
<seg id="41"> but this kind of thinking is the greatest barrier to democracy, because these people do not understand that negotiation and cooperation are the most important means and channel to realizing democracy. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>

</poster>
<seg id="3"> during this year's spring festival, i was fortunate enough to spend the new year in the countryside visiting some family and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> while being caught up in the rich new year's atmosphere in china's countryside, i also became worried about the lack of interesting cultural activities in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> i discovered in a friend's village that in past years the village would set out on its own each spring festival to organize the villagers in putting on a local play called "the galloping horse lantern". </seg>
<seg id="6"> the play takes as its subject the characters from the three kingdoms. adults and children can all enact a role in the play. the villagers never tire of watching. </seg>
<seg id="7"> in this way, there are several "galloping horse lantern" performance troupes throughout the county. they perform not only in their own village, but also travel to other villages, with the exchange between villages becoming very lively. </seg>
<seg id="8"> but this year the village did not organize a troupe. </seg>
<seg id="9"> , it seems that it took a lot of money just to buy the costumes for "the galloping horse lantern". in the past, the villagers would each contribute some cash, but now the costumes are tattered to the point that they can no longer be worn. </seg>
<seg id="10"> a house-to-house appeal was made to the villagers to again fork out money, but none was willing. a similar situation has arisen in other villages throughout the county. </seg>
<seg id="11"> without the "galloping horse lantern", the village has suddenly become cold and cheerless. </seg>
<seg id="12"> the adults have started playing mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> the children have also started playing cards. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the villagers all say that this new year's was dull. </seg>
<seg id="15"> other than setting off firecrackers, everybody just played mahjong and that became the general backdrop of chinese new year in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="16"> in addition, repeated bans have failed to halt a gambling craze that is showing a tendency to spread. games involving upwards of ten thousand yuan have become a common occurrence, with the large number of returning migrant workers playing a particularly important role in many games. </seg>
<seg id="17"> in this way, money earned from a year of hard work is squandered. </seg>
<seg id="18"> also, family squabbles stemming from gambling sometimes occur. some even descend into tragedies where families are split or life is lost. </seg>
<seg id="19"> some farmers say that they gamble not only during the spring festival, but also often during the slack season. </seg>
<seg id="20"> if they don't gamble, they don't have anywhere to go. </seg>
<seg id="21"> in the countryside, it is too difficult to organize cultural activities or find entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="22"> not only is there a lack of facilities and funds, but also nobody volunteers to handle the organization. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in this respect, the method used in jiangxi is doubtlessly welcome news for rural dwellers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in order to enrich the cultural life of the rural population, the jiangxi provincial government has not only implemented as of september last year a program of "government funding, market operation, town construction of stages and villagers watching plays", </seg>
<seg id="25"> but also organizes each year a special fund of at least rmb60 million for rural cultural projects in order to provide the rural population high quality cultural products. </seg>
<seg id="26"> with the new year, it added an additional rmb40 million, making a rural cultural project fund totaling rmb100 million. </seg>
<seg id="27"> for the rural population, the fruits of this special fund are also very substantial: </seg>
<seg id="28"> they invite various types of professional performance troupes to come to the villages to perform. each village cannot have less than four performances each year. </seg>

<seg id="3"> kidnap warning for wang peirong's child was a false alarm </seg>
<seg id="4"> after nine o'clock on the evening of january 24, 2006, the child of wang peirong finished relating the following: </seg>
<seg id="5"> while making up classes in physics at xuzhou's no. 3 middle school on the morning of january 24, 2006, wang peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the entrance guard informed wang peirong's child that three unidentified men had said the following to the entrance guards of no. 3 middle school:  wang peirong's child, wang tianjiao, has not returned home for three days because the father and mother of wang peirong's child are not getting along. </seg>
<seg id="7"> now her mother is missing. we are leaders from her mother's work unit and want to enter no. 3 middle school to get wang peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> wang peirong's child told the entrance guards that what the three men had said was completely untrue and she refused to go with the three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> with the help of the entrance guards of no. 3 middle school, wang peirong's child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wang peirong's child phoned her mother's leader at noon to find out what was going on. the leader denied sending anybody to xuzhou's no. 3 middle school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> wang peirong's child asked her for the phone number of her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="12"> wang peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> wang peirong's child said: three people came to no. 3 middle school to take me away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the leader asked: why didn't you go with them? </seg>
<seg id="15"> wang peirong's child answered: if i had gone with them i would be dead for sure. </seg>
<seg id="16"> when she had finished speaking, wang peirong's child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> hearing a description of the events from his child, wang peirong felt that the situation was serious and reported it to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> on january 25, the local police station received feedback that the story told by wang peirong's child was essentially true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the police station asked the kuangda security department if they had sent people to the no. 3 middle school to get wang peirong's child. they responded that they hadn't. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the police station again asked the kuangda security department if any of its branch units had sent people to no. 3 middle school to get wang peirong's child. they again answered that they hadn't. </seg>
<seg id="21"> through them, the relevant departments warned wang peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> following the event, the leaders of the relevant departments of xuzhou municipality paid close attention. </seg>
<seg id="23"> the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou public security bureau excluded the possibility of a kidnap attempt against the child. </seg>
<seg id="24"> wang peirong thanked the relevant department heads of the xuzhou municipality and the criminal investigation department of xuzhou public security department. </seg>
<seg id="25"> it was a false alarm. the main cause of the false alarm was possibly the entrance guards of no. 3 middle school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> the criminal investigation department of the xuzhou public security bureau has learned: on january 24, the leader of the college of science, which is wang peirong's work unit, and three other individuals urgently needed to find wang peirong (wang peirong still does not know why they were looking for him) and could not find him  by telephone. they thought of going to no. 3 middle school to find the teacher of wang peirong's child in order to ask if wang peirong's child was still in xuzhou. </seg>
<seg id="27"> a weighty topic: why is the risk involved in corruption relatively low while the cost of fighting corruption is high? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> under the present cadre system and anti-corruption system, what corrupt officials need to be worry about is a few relevant officials overseeing them, not the broad masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> therefore, once they feel that they have successfully hoodwinked or contented those few officials that can determine their fate, they can they feel reassured and unafraid as they carry out their great project of corruptly and illegally collecting wealth while disregarding the feelings of the nearby masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="31"> on the contrary, if the common people who don't hold any power come across an injustice and stand up against corruption, they will possibly provoke an extremely brutal reprisal, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or be branded by the government and end up at any time being crushed in defeat before obtaining any victory. </seg>
<seg id="33"> a comparison of the two: engaging in corruption is relatively risk free, while the cost of resisting corruption on the other hand is high. </seg>

<seg id="1"> now let's take a look at the iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> the international atomic energy agency verified on the 6th that the iranian government had sent a letter to the international atomic energy agency demanding that it dismantle and remove all equipment monitoring iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> because the international atomic energy agency decided to report the iran nuclear issue to the united nations security council, iran has announced the termination of all support and cooperation measures it had adopted with respect to the nuclear issue, and it will not longer permit the international atomic energy agency to perform surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> targeting the current tense situation with respect to the iranian nuclear issue, russian foreign minister lavrov said on the 6th in athens that the cooperation between russia and iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> this will become the driving force in the resolution of the iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> on the same day, a spokesperson for the russian ministry of foreign affairs said that russia's proposal to iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within russia's borders was still effective. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the two parties could engage in negotiations concerning this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> on the same day, at united nations headquarters in new york, senator lugar, chairman of the united states senate foreign relations committee, said that the united states does not approve of israeli attacks of iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> according to recent reports, israeli defense experts have said that, if necessary, israel could severely damage iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> xinhua news agency reports that on the 7th, russian deputy foreign minister kislyak said russia is willing to cooperate with iran regarding the nuclear issue and help iran obtain the legal authority to peacefully develop nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> kislyak said that russia's proposal to iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with iran remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="12"> russia hopes to hold negotiations with iran concerning this issue in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13"> at the end of december last year, russia submitted a proposal to iran that the two countries establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within russia's borders. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the european union and the united states both said that they could accept this compromise proposal. </seg>
<seg id="15"> but iran hopes russia will continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> on the 7th, chinese ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson kong quan said that although the international atomic energy agency had reported the iran atomic energy problem to the united nations security council, it had not transferred the agency's responsibility to handle the iranian nuclear issue to the security council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> therefore, the various parties must still break the deadlock over the iran nuclear issue within the framework of the international atomic energy agency. </seg>
<seg id="18"> according to a resolution of the international atomic energy agency, international atomic energy agency general director baradei will deliver a report concerning the iran nuclear issue to the security council in march. </seg>
<seg id="19"> after evaluating this report, the security council will make a final decision. </seg>
<seg id="20"> we feel that this resolution mentions requiring iran to, uh, fulfill the relevant security council resolutions and the promises it has made, and has not submitted or transferred this problem to the security council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> for some time recently, china has sought a peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear issue through diplomatic means. </seg>
<seg id="22"> kong quan said that on february 1, zhang yan, director-general of the chinese ministry of foreign affairs department of arms control and disarmament, held talks in tehran concerning the iran nuclear issue with lalijiani, negotiating representative of the secretariat of the supreme security council of iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> the chinese hope iran will attach importance to the international community as the key to creating conditions for a peaceful resolution of the iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> resolution of the iranian nuclear issue within the iaea framework is not only in china's interests; moreover, we firmly believe that it is in the interests of all parties. </seg>
<seg id="25"> to this end, we once again call on the concerned parties in the international community to not abandon the diplomatic efforts made regarding this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> hamas, which is currently in the process of forming the new palestinian self-rule government, has announced that, with the exception of the prime minister, the nominees for the new government's cabinet are essentially in place. </seg>
<seg id="2"> this has triggered all manner of speculation among outsiders concerning the selection of the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> on the 8th, a senior hamas official disclosed to the associated press that hamas was prepared to nominate ((businessman)) khudari, chairman of the board of trustees of islamic university in gaza, but this nomination has yet to be formally submitted to abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> with the support of hamas, khudari, who is now 51, participated in palestine's parliamentary election last month as an independent candidate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> khudari has never mentioned violence or opposition to israel in his public speeches. </seg>
<seg id="6"> but he has said that palestine must engage in internal reform. </seg>
<seg id="7"> a high-level hamas delegation is currently visiting cairo to discuss the issue of hamas' formation of the new palestinian authority government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> on the 8th, khaled masha'al, a member of the delegation, told the press that despite the constant pressure from the international community and certain arab countries, the palestinian government formed by hamas leaders would not recognize israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> at the same time, masha'al warned abbas in his statement: do not arbitrarily change the structure of palestinian leadership without consulting hamas in advance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> analysts believe that this was in response to abbas' plan to appoint interior minister yousef as deputy commander of security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> and concerning the issue of the formation of a new palestinian self-rule government, masha'al declined to verify the news that hamas was preparing to nominate ((businessman)) khudari, chairman of the board of trustees of islamic university in gaza to serve as the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="12"> masha'al said, "the nominee for prime minister has yet to be determined." </seg>
<seg id="13"> prior to masha'al's reiteration of the refusal to recognize israel, in an egyptian television interview, ma'erzuke, another hamas political leader, said, "hamas will absolutely not recognize the legal status of israel, but the new government will continue have contacts with israel in a variety of areas. because whether or not one recognizes israel and whether or not one has dealings with it are two different matters." </seg>
<seg id="14"> setting aside the new animosity and old grudges toward israel of the three hamas nominees for prime minister, territorial issues have always been a sticking point in palestinian-israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> in an interview with israeli television channel 2 on the 7th, ehud olmert, acting prime minister of israel, said that israel must be separated from palestine through the delineation of a permanent border. </seg>
<seg id="16"> this implies that israel will have no choice but to withdraw from some of the territory on the west bank of the jordan river. </seg>
<seg id="17"> however, olmert stressed that israel will continue to control large jewish settlements on the west bank of the jordan and the jordan river valley area, and will preserve the integrity of jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="1"> immediately following the international atomic energy agency's decision to hand the iran nuclear issue over to the united nations security council, iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiations with the united states, one of the proponents. </seg>
<seg id="2"> uh, an iranian government spokesperson said on monday that the policy toward the united states implemented to date has been not to discuss or negotiate its relationship with the opposing party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> he said that it was a major mistake for the west to hand the nuclear issue over to the security council, demonstrating the west's obstruction of iran's development. </seg>
<seg id="4"> on sunday, iran said that it was suspending cooperation with the international atomic energy agency, and would resume uranium extraction and enrichment and prohibit surprise inspections of nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> so with respect to this issue, iran's current attitude is relatively unyielding, and the attitude of the united states is even more unyielding. </seg>
<seg id="6"> uh, american secretary of defense rumsfeld has already reasserted multiple times that the use of military force has not been ruled out with respect to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="7"> uh, now it is rumored that the u.s. military is really in the process of implementing such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> they are developing a kind of superhuge bomb called the mother of bombs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> uh, once the defense department orders it, they will use this superhuge, uh, bomb to bomb iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> so how big a bomb is this mother of bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> according to reports, just in terms of weight, it is 30,000 pounds, equivalent to a double decker bus, and, uh, it is also extremely large in volume. </seg>
<seg id="12"> uh, the development of such a super bomb is primarily in order to bomb certain, uh, underground facilities in iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> because of its extremely strong penetration force--it can pass through concrete as well as steel plates--it is likely to create a large pit equivalent to 60 meters long half a mile, destroying many such, uh, underground structures and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> so now it appears that the united states has truly begun provisionally polishing its guns or provisionally making bombs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> regarding this issue, rumsfeld says that no means have been ruled out to resolve the iran nuclear issue, and military means had already been placed on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> also, the iran nuclear issue is continually upgrading, so, uh, when interviewed by this station, a concerned iranian official stationed in washington said that in fact, iran continued to uphold the adoption of peaceful negotiations to cooperate with international society, and, uh, they hoped to alleviate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> but he also said that iran would adjust the contents of its nuclear project in cooperation with russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> regarding the second round of negotiations between iran and russia concerning the uranium enrichment project, iran said that the negotiations would proceed as originally planned, but it emphasized that the changes occurring in the current situation made it necessary to make some adjustments to the content of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> previously, russia had always expressed support for iran's peaceful use of nuclear power, and it had expressed that it would insist on not submitting the iran nuclear issue to the security council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> however, now we see that they have already approved the submission of the iran nuclear issue to the u.n. security council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> with this new situation, we therefore may make some changes to the policies arrived at previously with russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> and, prior to the u.n. security council's final decision as to whether or not to adopt economic and political sanctions in march, iran has advocated continuous negotiations with international agencies, and it is willing to cooperate with the international community, thereby alleviating the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> we emphasize, in order to fight for our own economic development and national construction, iran will not relinquish the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> iran has not violated relevant international laws. we hope that the united states can also understand this. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the iran nuclear issue is completely different from the problems in afghanistan and iraq. </seg>
<seg id="26"> i think the united states is also very clear on this point. </seg>
<seg id="27"> as for so-called military attacks, we have not seen any clear statement of position from the united states. </seg>
<seg id="28"> we do not wish to see the crisis escalate further. </seg>
<seg id="29"> we also emphasize that we want to use peaceful negotiating methods, but we will not submit to pressure. </seg>

<seg id="42"> several states in the eastern united states coverage area have been affected, such as maryland, with 21 inches of accumulation, pennsylvania with 19 inches, and new york and new jersey with accumulations in excess of 24 inches. </seg>

<seg id="3"> but great controversy has been stirred up during this process, which has met with one snag after another. </seg>
<seg id="4"> recently, scandals have arisen when japan's defense facilities administration agency, which is subordinate to the defense agency, placed requests for bids, uh, requests for construction bids, resulting in arrests by authorities of certain current and former officials. </seg>

<seg id="17"> with her becoming pregnant again at this age, many people could not help but guess that, uh, a struggle for the throne could be playing out between the brothers of the royal family. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of course, many people are delighted to talk about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> to explain this matter may require going back several years. </seg>
<seg id="20"> uh, it was like this: at the time, in '02, because crown prince naruhito, uh, his wife, became depressed, the royal family did not hold out much hope for them at the time, so they turned to exerting pressure on prince akishino. </seg>
<seg id="21"> at that time, there was not much response from akishino. </seg>
<seg id="22"> but by 2004, the contradiction intensified somewhat, because naruhito, eager to protect his wife, blamed the royal family in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> well, according to reports, the royal family was infuriated, and demanded that prince akishino, who is of the same generation, step forward to make a rebuttal, saying that his elder brother had been disrespectful to the royal family, and was doting on his wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> from then on, there has been discord between the brothers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> so now, if, uh, prince akishino bears a son, then their, uh, main axis will become a pillar of the, uh, royal family. </seg>
<seg id="26"> and that will assuredly cause a decline of the eastern palace, that is, the crown prince. </seg>
<seg id="27"> uh, so a good many people believe that if this happens, it will have a great impact on the royal family and japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="1"> united nations secretary general annan went to the white house monday to meet with american president bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> regarding iran's announced postponement of nuclear negotiations with russia, annan urged iran to cease nuclear activities as quickly as possible, and to resolve problems through negotiations rather than confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> another news item indicates that the u.s. department of defense has already begun plans for intensive bombing of iran, to serve as the ultimate backup plan if diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> originally, outsiders thought that bush and annan would discuss the possibility of un security council sanctions against iran, but the two did not announce discussions in this regard after their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> bush and annan both emphasized that they hoped the iranian nuclear issue would be resolved through negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="6"> annan expressed concerns over iran's commencement of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear negotiations with russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> on the same day, the u.s. media reported that military strategists at the pentagon had already begun intensive planning of military actions to be adopted with respect to iran; in the event that diplomatic efforts fail, the u.s. will use military means to halt iran's development of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> according to reports, the commander of the u.s. central command is in the process of determining attack targets. </seg>
<seg id="9"> attack methods could include submarine-launched ballistic missles and air strikes by b-2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> on monday, annan called on all parties not to adopt actions that would escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> according to analysis by military experts, iran could have the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> and there are still more than two years remaining in bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> he will strive to resolve the iran nuclear issue during his term, whether by peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> mo naiqian, phoenix satellite news, reporting from washington. </seg>
<seg id="15"> on the 13th, iranian president ahmadinejad said superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons were about to disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> while commemorating the 27th anniversary of the islamic revolution, ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries. </seg>
<seg id="17"> he said that the arms contests and competitions in the scramble for hegemony among various countries in the world would not yield results. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the appetites of superpowers can never be satisfied. they even threaten other countries with their weapons. </seg>
<seg id="19"> but he said these superpowers who rely on weapons to threaten other countries would disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the day when mankind enjoys permanent peace and stability is about to arrive. </seg>
<seg id="21"> thus it can be seen that this is now not merely, um, a war of words, but really and truly, um, this kind of saber rattling between iran and the western world and america is now getting worse and worse. </seg>
<seg id="22"> so, because the, uh, attitudes between iraq and the united states are mutually unyielding, recently, the situation has changed somewhat; the day before yesterday, iran formally announced that it was resuming its plans to extract and enrich uranium. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in fact, some western diplomats surmised that they may very well have actually resumed certain processes in uranium extraction and enrichment prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> additionally, iran announced that it was postponing negotiations with russia indefinitely; the negotiations concerned russia extracting and enriching uranium instead of iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> so of course the indefinite postponement of this negotiation plan was also determined with respect to the current, new situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> uh, recently, because the united states, uh, has continued its threats to attack iran, a u.k. think tank, the oxford institute, has issued a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> if the united states actually adopts military force, it will result in the death of half of the people, and of course it will trigger, uh, the possible continuation of this year's, uh, wave of violence in the middle east. </seg>
<seg id="28"> also, some, uh, terrorist attacks will also worsen. </seg>
<seg id="29"> of course, oil prices will also rise sharply. this is also among the, uh, this series of domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> moreover, the report also says that if the united states is unable to make iran submit, it will certainly accelerate iran's determination to produce nuclear weapons itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> so, we have just mentioned the issue of negotiations between russia and iran. </seg>
<seg id="32"> an iranian government spokesperson indeed indicated on monday that due to the emergence of the new situation, the negotiations with russian officials concerning the extraction and enrichment of uranium inside russia originally set for the 16th would be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="33"> a russian ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson said that they had not received formal notification from iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> so it is currently still too early to say whether the meeting will go on. </seg>
<seg id="35"> additionally, on monday, uh, the head of russia's federal international atomic energy agency, guqinuofu, said that the russians had already prepared the conditions and principles for negotiations with iran concerning the nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="8"> at the same time that it invited china to participate in the military exercises, the u.s. also mentioned its hope that the operations of china's people's liberation army would become more transparent. some defense experts therefore believe this demonstrates that the pentagon is puzzled by china's intentions to expand its military, and hopes to use joint military exercises to  engage in mutual probing and exploration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> additionally, because the defense evaluation report issued by the pentagon earlier this month views china as the greatest future potential threat, two defense experts have also indicated that asia-pacific military exercises are the u.s. defense department's first step toward adjusting its strategy based on this. </seg>

<seg id="45"> er, in addition, according to a report from pakistan's privately-run geo on the evening of the 15th, in an interview with that station that evening, baber bashir, the chief executive officer of pakistan's attock cement factory, indicated that after the occurrence of this attack, pakistan, er, would arrange, um, for the remaining eleven chinese engineers and technicians working on this project to return to their countries, ah, as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="46"> in the interview, this bashir also said that concerning, ah, the doubts raised by some pakistani media about why, er, when the incident occurred, the chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel, er,  he said, uh, in fact, the factory where these engineers worked has its own security system, but because the location where the incident occurred was still within the scope of the factory area, there were no security personnel accompanying them when the incident occurred. </seg>
<seg id="47"> so, he expressed great regret at the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident. </seg>
<seg id="48"> anchor. </seg>
<seg id="49"> yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="50"> er, also, this was not the first time that chinese engineers were attacked and killed in pakistan. </seg>

<seg id="52"> two chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed organization in south waziristan. </seg>
<seg id="53"> ultimately, one of them lost his life during the rescue operation. </seg>

<seg id="56"> on may 3, '04, in the port of gwadar in the southern part of pakistan's balochistan province, a van carrying twelve chinese nationals encountered a car bombing attack on its way to a worksite at the harbor. </seg>
<seg id="57"> the result: three chinese engineers died, and nine were injured. </seg>
<seg id="58"> it is believed that this attack was initiated by local separatists and tribal militias. </seg>
<seg id="59"> on october 9 of the same year, two chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in the south waziristan region along the border between pakistan and afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> during an attempt to rescue the hostages by pakistani forces soon thereafter, one of the engineers was unfortunately shot and killed. </seg>
<seg id="61"> however, this hostage incident is believed to have been perpetrated by an armed organization related to a jihadist organization, not by the separatist militia. </seg>
<seg id="62"> because china has a close economic relationship with pakistan, and is participating in the construction of pakistan's infrastructure, a good many chinese engineering personnel work there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> and pakistan has tribal militia organizations accusing the government of plundering their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> this has resulted in multiple instances of chinese people becoming the victims of attacks and kidnappings. </seg>

<seg id="1"> let's look at several news stories from japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> recently there was this bit of relatively shocking news from japan's world of politics. </seg>
<seg id="3"> which was that tsuneo watanabe, the, um, chairman of japanese media giant yomiuri shimbun, ordered, uh, yomiuri shimbun to publish some articles opposing koizumi's visit to the yasukuni shrine, and yomiuri shimbun's, um, position since then has, uh, been in opposition to koizumi's visit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> uh, so, in a speech several days ago, this tsuneo watanabe, uh, he criticized koizumi severely, saying that he was extremely ignorant and lacked any historical or cultural knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="5"> at the same time, he also said that a visit by koizumi to the yasukuni shrine would be like paying tribute to hitler, and he said that by doing so, koizumi would cause china and korea to view japan as an extremely dangerous country, and this would be a constant source of trouble in the future. </seg>
<seg id="6"> so why would this attitude of tsuneo watanabe's cause such a great commotion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> in fact, he is very influential in political circles, and has always been a controlling character behind the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> and he, uh, was a person who was far to the right in the past. </seg>
<seg id="9"> it should be said that he has always supported the hawk faction, and he has worked hard to promote amendment of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> but, uh, now, he has truly made a major about face. </seg>
<seg id="11"> he has turned the muzzle of his gun and begun shooting at koizumi, adopting an attitude of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> actually, when people attacked koizumi for visiting the yasukuni shrine in 2004, this tsuneo watanabe still said, uh, he said he supported it, and he wanted koizumi to resist the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> but in a recent talk, he said, "i'm already over eighty years old, i don't have much time left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> so now, he comes out in lofty tones, speaking out with a sort of very anti-war attitude. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the effect of this, um, change of sides on his part on japanese society as a whole naturally remains great. </seg>
<seg id="16"> for example, concerning himself, he said, "i firmly believe i have this kind of assurance and the ability to change political trends." </seg>
<seg id="17"> he also said that if yomiuri shimbun received government pressure in the areas of free speech and editorial freedom, he would resist it with his life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> so what kind of situation has taken shape now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> japan's biggest newspaper, yomiuri shimbun, and japan's second biggest newspaper, the super asahi shimbun, have begun to join hands in opposition to koizumi's yasukuni shrine visits. </seg>
<seg id="20"> originally, these two major papers were at odds with each other, but after the two chairmen met, they at least reached a consensus on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="21"> thus now, both of them have adopted major offensives to, uh, criticize koizumi. they can be said to be a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> in fact, these two major newspapers should still have, uh, enormous influence on mainstream public opinion in japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> also, let's take a look at the current legislative session in japan. at a recent meeting, two of the more popular candidates to succeed japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi both said the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="24"> who are these two? </seg>
<seg id="25"> yes, one is chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe, and the other is japanese foreign minister tari aso, who has repeatedly made astonishing statements recently. </seg>
<seg id="26"> what did the two of them say? </seg>
<seg id="27"> they said that japan's, uh, world war ii war criminals were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> what they meant was, uh, it was the international court that called them, um, criminals, and convicted them of crimes. </seg>
<seg id="29"> but domestically in japan, based on international law, based on japan's domestic laws, they, the war criminals, had not violated japan's domestic laws. </seg>
<seg id="30"> therefore, they believe that japan should not view the world war ii war criminals as criminals. </seg>
<seg id="31"> at the same time, this shinzo abe also mentioned that japan should now turn its eyes to the world at large, develop its relationship with the united states, develop its trade relationships with certain southeast asian countries, and do its utmost to develop a close relationship with india, and not always focus on china. </seg>

<seg id="4"> the luneng taishan (of shandong province) soccer team is getting ready for the next season, preparing to make another advance for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="5"> three strong teams, dalian, luneng, and shanghai, will fight for the championship </seg>
<seg id="6"> in the end, who will be the champion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> according to analysis of their strength, although the luneng team has great hope of winning the championship, it does not have 100% assurance. </seg>
<seg id="8"> first of all, the new players only have a short time to train and be broken in. </seg>
<seg id="9"> last year luneng came home empty from the four big games. </seg>
<seg id="10"> this year luneng has brought in two famous national players, li leilei and wang liang, and soon there will be two foreign players that will join the ranks as well.  the team's power can be said to have had increases and no decreases. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, because the national team must prepare for competitions with pakistan and iraq, the national players won't be able to practice with their team mates. </seg>
<seg id="12"> when they finally return to their club, the tournament will begin shortly; </seg>
<seg id="13"> thus the breaking in and integration of new players is the biggest problem faced by luneng. </seg>
<seg id="14"> i think that in the first few rounds of the tournament they should let the national players play second string. </seg>
<seg id="15"> firstly they can use the competitions to break in and integrate the ranks, </seg>
<seg id="16"> and secondly they can allow these players who played in two national group competitions to rest a bit. </seg>
<seg id="17"> after a few rounds, when the 'knives' are broken in, it will not be too late for them to come into play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> also, the team has hidden trouble with its defense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> in the past, luneng's defense has been denounced by fans, </seg>
<seg id="20"> this year, with the addition of li leilei, the team's defense has improved but is far from being foolproof. </seg>
<seg id="21"> the problem of middle rear guards being slow at turning around the ball still exists, and second string players are either too old or lack experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if middle rear guards are stable in their abilities this year, then another step will be taken toward luneng's road to the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> i believe that the team should use ren yongshun, whose physical condition is good.  although he lacks experience, he can train this year, and prepare for the present and future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> besides this, gao yao is good at playing both forward and rear positions . </seg>
<seg id="25"> luneng has many players that can play center field, cui peng and hai bin can play this position. </seg>
<seg id="26"> gao yao's body is strong, he's good at stealing the ball, and in the position of middle rear guard he should be able to do a good job. </seg>
<seg id="27"> once again, if the foreign players will be suitable or not is a problem. </seg>
<seg id="28"> foreign players are a big problem that has always complicated luneng. </seg>
<seg id="29"> last year, the unleashing of ionel danciulescu left many unimpressed, </seg>
<seg id="30"> and selections for this year's foreign players have still not been made. </seg>
<seg id="31"> i think that this year, besides bringing in a extraordinary forward, they should also bring in a pure left forward guard, </seg>
<seg id="32"> except for xing rui from several years ago, luneng doesn't have a left footer in the true meaning. </seg>
<seg id="33"> although cui peng and other can live up to the position, a true left forward guard would be much better than guest players. </seg>
<seg id="34"> if these three problems are resolved, luneng's road to gain the championship should be more even. </seg>
<seg id="35"> as a luneng fan, i hope that luneng wins the championship this year, </seg>
<seg id="36"> however, to tell the truth, the shape of this year's championship has luneng with great hopes but no great assurances. </seg>

<seg id="3"> hello everybody, </seg>
<seg id="4"> spring festival has once again run past us just like that, and those friends who put their vacation time and their spring festival holiday break together are one by one returning to their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> wishing all friends a happy new year, if i say happy new year now it doesn't count as too late. </seg>
<seg id="6"> one day i was chatting with nplcn in a cafe, and he talked about today's brandvista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the website is much more beautiful, </seg>
<seg id="8"> the placement of content isn't bad, </seg>
<seg id="9"> and what he liked most was the community bbs based on discuz, which is now getting a comprehensive update. </seg>
<seg id="10"> mentioning the community, i must thank a certain person, </seg>
<seg id="11"> that is the general manager of the discuz beijing company, mr. li mingshun. </seg>
<seg id="12"> doing a search on google with his name, you'll get many results; </seg>
<seg id="13"> you probably know that before he was at sina, he established a business himself, making a small- and medium-enterprise internet advertisement exchange platform similar to the foreign adbrite.com. </seg>
<seg id="14"> at that time i argued with him on msn that his main meaning was: vista thinks the development of many of china's industries relies on the strengthening of the private economy and small and medium industries, </seg>
<seg id="15"> and currently in the chinese market, this situation does not allow people to be optimistic; </seg>
<seg id="16"> thus creative industries and similar consultative agencies in service of small and medium enterprises have no way to take shape in any scope, </seg>
<seg id="17"> and demand a relatively high fee to facilitate self development, finally leading to a recurring cycle that is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="18"> later he came to discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> discuz is a truly outstanding community program based on the php and mysql databases; </seg>
<seg id="20"> with the help of beijing technical engineer ramboo, the brandvista community finally saw light once again, and came into the market in full force. </seg>
<seg id="21"> feedback has been very good, </seg>
<seg id="22"> the user interface is clean and friendly, </seg>
<seg id="23"> the speed is fast; </seg>
<seg id="24"> under a spotlessly clean user interface, writing a little text that leaves me inspired and others enlightened, and exchanging every little fact about life and work with friends and coworkers with the same pursuits, i began to believe that this is a kind of joy. </seg>
<seg id="25"> thank you discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> news in the advertisement industry of late is rather substantial. </seg>
<seg id="27"> beginning in january, the wto's opening up of institutions related to the advertisement industry will begin to be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="28"> major foreigners have already arrived one after another, and lesser foreigners are sharpening their knives; it seems to be a scene of prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the problems of batey ads of singapore are rather numerous; </seg>
<seg id="30"> under the circumstances of consecutively losing several heavyweight customers, and seeing setback after setback on the mainland, sir martin finally took a little time from the italian lawsuit to think about shuffling his cards. </seg>
<seg id="31"> batey ads merged with jwt.com, keeping its brand name, but managed by jwt. </seg>
<seg id="32"> at the same time, there are also rumors saying bates and 141 net will soon merge into the ogilvy system, with management being carried out by ogilvy advertising; </seg>
<seg id="33"> although before this, 141 already reported to ogilvy; allowing bates to report to ogilvy is also an interesting matter. </seg>
<seg id="34"> during spring festival, the website had many articles updated; i won't tell of all of them here; </seg>
<seg id="35"> if everybody has time, you can get onto the website and look at them. </seg>
<seg id="36"> at the same time, for those friends who have not yet entered the new forums, there is no hindrance for you to click your mouse a little more, and then you can enter brandvista's totally new community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> feel the environment, experience the atmosphere, contribute some writing. </seg>
<seg id="38"> i hope you are able to feel and find the happiness of our organization </seg>
<seg id="39"> wishing that all friends are in a wonderful mood. </seg>
<seg id="40"> best regards! </seg>

<seg id="4"> this is not an impulse on thought, instead it is warm goodness long held in one's heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> ask yourself if it were you, what would you have done; </seg>
<seg id="6"> the answer is very clear, i would have put down the telephone saying, "wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> this year i have been thinking about when all is said and done, what actually counts as helping people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> i have already abandoned all behaviors like donating money and donating items. </seg>
<seg id="9"> in the last few days i've had friends say, i already have no time to care for myself; in helping people, my heart is full of vigor but by my strength lacking. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wishing you a day of happiness : ) </seg>
<seg id="11"> helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> mother of ten years ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> it was one day ten years ago when this teacher was using the noon rest time to sleep at her home; suddenly the telephone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> she received the call and listened, and out came a strange and rough sound: "your child was stealing books and now she's been caught by us, come quickly!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> from out of the receiver also came the noise of a young girl crying, and the sounds of chiding from people surrounding the young girl. </seg>
<seg id="16"> she looked over at her only daughter who was watching tv, and she immediately understood. </seg>
<seg id="17"> it was definitely a young girl who was caught by the salesperson stealing books, but was not willing to allow her family to learn of this; thus, she made up a phone number, and by coincidence it rung at the teacher's home. </seg>
<seg id="18"> of course the teacher could put down the phone and take no notice of this -- she could even rebuke the person on the receiving end, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this event had no connection to her whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id="20"> but she was a teacher, and maybe the girl was her student </seg>
<seg id="21"> through the telephone, she could vaguely imagine that the little girl who had a momentary lapse in judgment with serious consequences must be extremely nervous and scared; she was facing perhaps the most frightening circumstances ever in her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> after hesitating for a moment the teacher suddenly thought of an idea -- yes, she'd just do it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> therefore, after she got the address of the bookstore, she immediately went there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> just as she expected, in the bookstore stood a little girl with a face full of tears, </seg>
<seg id="25"> and the adults around her were fiercely chiding her. </seg>
<seg id="26"> she rushed up at once, hugging that poor little girl and turning to the salesperson by her side, saying, "talk to me about this, don't frighten the child." </seg>
<seg id="27"> while the salesperson grumbled that he was not willing, she handed over a fine of several tens of rmb before taking this little girl out of the bookstore and getting a clear look at a face in a complete mess with tears and panic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> she began smiling and took the little girl to her home, cleaned her up without asking anything, and then allowed the little girl to leave. </seg>
<seg id="29"> before she left, the teacher urged her: "if you want to read, just come to me; there are many books here." </seg>
<seg id="30"> the little girl whose spirits were still rattled took a good look at her, and then ran off like she was flying, never appearing again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> time passed rapidly like running water, and without realizing it, ten years of time had passed in a flash; </seg>
<seg id="32"> the teacher had already forgotten this event long ago, but she still lived in the same place, leading a peaceful and serene life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> one day at noon, a knocking sound came from outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> after she had opened the house door, she saw a young and beautiful unfamiliar girl, who had a face full of smiles and a large pile of gifts in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "who are you looking for?," </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked uncertainly. </seg>
<seg id="37"> the girl then excitingly talked at length. </seg>
<seg id="38"> with great difficulty, she suddenly discovered from the story told by this strange girl that it turned out she was the little girl from before, ten years before; she had already graduated from college without any trouble, and now she had gone to the trouble to come to pay a call to the teacher. </seg>
<seg id="39"> the eyes of this young girl were glinting with tears, and she spoke softly: "although i still don't understand even to this day why were you willing to pretend you were my mother and rescue me, i always think, during these past ten years, about how i've always wanted to call you mother." </seg>
<seg id="40"> the teacher's eyes also began to become fuzzy; </seg>
<seg id="41"> she asked with some curiosity: "if that day i had not helped you, what would have been the result?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> the girl's face immediately became somber; lightly she shook her head and said; "i can't say for sure; perhaps i would have done something stupid, even died." </seg>
<seg id="43"> the teacher's heart suddenly trembled and she began to inwardly congratulate herself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> the decision that she made in a moment of thought that year could actually influence the life of a person in such a way as this. </seg>
<seg id="45"> looking at the happy smiles on the face of the girl she also began to smile. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <headline> military survey: how long can iran last against american air strikes? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster> yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> if you make the analogy of a traditional war of attrition as making your opponent bleed until he dies, then modern warfare is like firing a gun into your opponent's head, making him become a 'vegetable' before he can even begin to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> the difference between iran and america's military does not lie in numbers, instead it lies in the understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> iran, which fought an eight-year war with iraq with no clear winner, still seems to not have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in the last few days, after analyzing the redeployment of american forces, england's "international intelligence commentary" pointed out that american forces are currently carrying out preparations to initiate a large scale air strike against iran. </seg>
<seg id="7"> the current situation of iran's air force worrisome </seg>
<seg id="8"> the current situation of iran's air force is relatively similar to iraq's air force before the 2003 war. </seg>
<seg id="9"> iran does not have the ability to research and develop modern weapons by itself, and also is restricted by a western arms embargo; </seg>
<seg id="10"> as soon as a war breaks out, whether or not the old aircraft in iran's air force will be able to get into the air and engage american forces is still a big question. </seg>
<seg id="11"> at present, iran's air defense system is mainly made up of the air forces of iran's regular army, land air defense units, and the air defense forces of the revolutionary guards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> among its forces, iran's air force has approximately 50,000 soldiers, and has over 300 war aircraft of various types; </seg>
<seg id="13"> its main models include american-made f-4 'phantoms', f-5 'tigers', f-14 'tomcats' and russian-made mig 29s and so on. </seg>
<seg id="14"> land-based air defense units are mainly equipped with a series of american-made 'hawks', british 'rapiers' and some russian-made 'sam' land-to-air missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> as to the present situation of iran's air defense power, american military expert harold hutchinson and russian government and military analysis institute military expert vladimir mytashin and others have analyzed this.  they believe that, looking at the current situation, there still exist some leaks in iran's air defense abilities and the air defense system establishment. </seg>
<seg id="16"> hutchinson believes that, talking about its comprehensive strength, iran's air forces and america's military are just not on the same level. </seg>
<seg id="17"> a great number of american-made fighters that iran is equipped with cannot be used because they lack spare parts and need upgraded maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> as of now only about 10 or a few more of the f-14 fighters which were once seen as the trump card in iran's air force can even get off the ground and fly, </seg>
<seg id="19"> and the actual battle reliability of the aim-54 model 'phoenix' cruise missile, which is reputed to have over the horizon strike ability, is suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="20"> mytashin points out that the air defense missile systems that america supplied to iran in the 70's and 80's have already lost their battle abilities because they lack spare parts, </seg>
<seg id="21"> and some other air defense weapons not incorporated into their own systems obtained from russia and other countries have no ability whatsoever to contend with american forces that have strong electromagnetic countermeasures. </seg>
<seg id="22"> a pieced together force influences iran's fighting power </seg>
<seg id="23"> iran's government obviously has recognized that its fate in a war depends on whether or not it can defend the skies above its head, and has thus made preparations at the last minute, and tried to further piece together and strengthen its air defense systems. </seg>
<seg id="24"> looking at this at the present, iran's method can be boiled down to these two strategies: </seg>
<seg id="25"> first, hide important nuclear facilities with the utmost effort, and strengthen their ability to resist attack. </seg>
<seg id="26"> according to england's "the times," iran already has deeply hidden its natanz nuclear factory and isfahan uranium enrichment center 18 meters underground, and added a two-meter thick concrete protecting shell. </seg>
<seg id="27"> however, american forces are one step ahead.  as early as during the 1991 gulf war, america had seen the efficiency of underground bunkers in air defense warfare and carried out an onslaught of research and development on various kinds of earth-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> after more than 10 years of specific research and development, american forces now already have a whole series of battle methods and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> recently iran also purchased advanced air defense weapons from russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> since late last year, the iranian government and russia have successively reached agreements on the purchase of 'pechora' 2a model air defense missile systems, as well as 29 'tor" m1 model air defense missile systems worth 700 million usd. </seg>
<seg id="31"> however, modern warfare is a measuring of system against system. </seg>
<seg id="32"> all of america's various air strike weapons were researched and developed by america, have seen many years of actual battle hardening, and have already been ground into a set of battle machines with objective effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id="33"> whereas iran has been piecing together 'new weapons' from other countries.  it is still a question if iran can create any battle power in such a short time. </seg>
<seg id="34"> iran's deficiencies not only in weapons </seg>
<seg id="35"> the 'airland battle' concept was first brought up in "operations" published by the u.s. armed forces in 1982.  it emphasized taking advantage of air superiority to carry out strikes on the enemy's strategic high value targets, and paralyzing the command system of the enemy as soon as war began, making enemies with even large and strong regular armed forces just "a piece of meat on the cutting board." </seg>
<seg id="36"> in the 1991 gulf war, the 1999 kosovo war and the 2003 iraq war, what american forces have been concerned about is not how many aircraft the opponent has, but instead the range of its 'tomahawk' cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> the iranian government is already carrying out preparations for air strikes that might happen, and has also begun procedures to strengthen its air defense abilities. however, iran, which fought an eight-year war with iraq with no clear winner, still seems not to have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> with the progress of military restructuring of american forces over the past few years, america's air strike performance is already totally different than the carpet bombing of the vietnam era, and instead relies on various high-tech weapons, the support of high accuracy current information technology and total-depth air strike ability. </seg>
<seg id="39"> facing these kind of air strikes, exactly how long iran's land-based air defense systems can last is still an unknown. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <headline> joining with google to take on microsoft, dell takes "shelving fees" from software providers </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster> yun feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> dell (dell inc. us) and google verified on tuesday that dell is currently testing the installation of a google software package on personal computers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> this move will likely become a serious threat to the leading position in the personal computer software market of microsoft (microsoft corp, msft). </seg>
<seg id="5"> jess blackburn, news spokesman for dell, expressed that his company is currently evaluating google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> after installing this software, personal computer users can use it to carry out searches on the internet and also search the information saved on personal computers. </seg>
<seg id="7"> blackburn verified that at present the software his company is evaluating includes a dell homepage supported by google, a google desktop search system and a google tool bar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> at the same time, google news spokesman jon murchinson verified his company is currently testing a batch of software developed by google with dell. </seg>
<seg id="9"> before this, "the wall street journal" had a report saying that it parvenu google is currently carrying out talks with dell, hp (hewlett-packard) and others, aiming to convince these computer manufacturing giants to install google software on their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> according to "the wall street journal," which cited a person with inside information, to reach this goal google will likely pay as much as one billion usd to dell over the next three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, neither of the two companies has revealed any relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> besides this, hp has declined to comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> microsoft news spokesperson neil charney refused to comment on the above news. </seg>
<seg id="14"> at present, microsoft is currently planning to release the search tools of the next generation windows operating system, as well as strengthening the development of its online services. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the day that this news became public, google stock once again fell by 4.46%, reaching 367.92 usd. </seg>
<seg id="16"> microsoft stock fell 1% that day, closing at 26.94 usd. </seg>
<seg id="17"> some analysts point out that google is currently impatiently searching for a direction for expansion besides internet searches, and joining with dell and other pc giants will spur google on to threaten microsoft's central services. </seg>
<seg id="18"> analyst matt rosoff of market research company directions on microsoft expressed that google is impatient to expand new income flows.  this is certainly what microsoft is concerned and worried about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> however, there are also analysts who don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> analyst charles di bona of market analysis company sanford c. bernstein pointed out that it is still too early for google to shake microsoft windows' leading position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> noted by the reporter: google loosening up microsoft's empire? </seg>
<seg id="22"> hui zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> there is no doubt that computers have already become a necessity of life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> however, while everybody is familiar with operating computers, there are only a small number of people who actually understand the principles that make computers work. </seg>
<seg id="25"> just like using 'simpleton' cameras, as long as the user interface is good and you use convenient software, the great majority of dummies can still thoroughly enjoy their computer . </seg>
<seg id="26"> because of this, the software that pc producers provide when they ship their goods often decides the use habits of a large number of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> microsoft has firmly taken hold of the personal computer operating system market through this measure. </seg>
<seg id="28"> as of now, microsoft's new opponent google also intends to use this method to take a share for itself. </seg>
<seg id="29"> a famous taiwanese economic media outlet recently gave an interesting analogy to this. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "dell, hp and other computer producers are starting to manage the computers they are sending out as the product shelves in a supermarket, and taking a "shelving fee" from software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> successful bidders can make their software appear in the 'crucial 10 minutes' when users first turn on their new computers, and lead consumers to use their products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> this type of fee pattern is like supermarkets taking a shelving fee from food suppliers." </seg>
<seg id="33"> there is no doubt that this phenomenon shows that microsoft's control is currently loosening. </seg>
<seg id="34"> microsoft managers have warned bill gates that if google starts to pay personal computer manufacturers to allow computers to be deployed with google's software, then microsoft's hegemonic position will in the end be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> no matter what the final result is, the leisurely days of microsoft sitting in the lead position will likely become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> after all, fighting an empire is easy, but defending an empire is hard. </seg>
<seg id="37"> in the eyes of quanda there is no major event -- all events in the world are common events </seg>

<seg id="7"> the article enumerated that all the manners in which the chinese communist party (ccp) overseas officials took to repress falun gong in various situations all failed, and students of falun gong across the world spoke the truth and left the ccp without any face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> but if you compare the great surge of those quitting the party because of the "nine criticisms" of 2005, then 2004 really doesn't seem like much. </seg>
<seg id="9"> so, what will 2006 bring? </seg>
<seg id="10"> from two events that happened early this year we can get an inkling as to the development of this year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the first event is the publishing of "eradicating evil."  this article pronounces a sentence that the final day of the ccp's special operatives after july 20, 1999 will soon arrive. </seg>
<seg id="12"> in regards to this article, perhaps many people will waver between believing or doubting it, or will not be able to believe it, </seg>
<seg id="13"> but no matter if you believe it or not, history and fact will provide proof! </seg>
<seg id="14"> of course, the special operatives of the ccp are just like rats that live in the sewer, </seg>
<seg id="15"> their "natural or unnatural" death will not bring the attention of society or public opinion, </seg>
<seg id="16"> however, the large-scale smiting or repentance of domestic and foreign based ccp operatives will bring about a huge attack and convulsion to the ccp power hierarchy! </seg>
<seg id="17"> under the awful magnitude of the smiting of their world, they will have to seriously consider their path of retreat and path of life -- quit the party, revolt and run, or change sides. </seg>
<seg id="18"> because of this, the 'ccp hyper-stable bureaucratic system bloc' held up by filthy interests will begin to shake, dissolve and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> there is also one event, that is, the hunger strike movement against those maintaining power begun by gao zhisheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> this movement that began suddenly and was not well received at first, exceeded expectations and received an enthusiastic response from all over the world, and was responded to jointly by figures and forces everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="21"> if this movement can become a nexus between various righteous powers and the suffering people, as well as become successful and large, then the final hit to the ccp, this wicked regime that is on the precipice ready to fall, will be given. </seg>
<seg id="22"> if we say that 2005 was the year that defeated communism on the spiritual level, then 2006 is the stage of defeating communism on a spiritual and material level. </seg>
<seg id="23"> with the further promulgation of the "nine criticisms," the deepening of the tide of people quitting the party, the self-dissolution of the ccp itself and the agglomeration and shaping up of outside righteous power, the life of the ccp monster will formally enter its final hours! </seg>
<seg id="24"> the desires of heaven and earth have already coalesced, the hand of god and the power of the people are currently assembling. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the long sword that relies on heaven is directly pointed at the ccp monster! </seg>
<seg id="26"> if you say 2004 was a year in which we advanced triumphantly, and 2005 is a year in which we surged forward with great momentum, then what will the end words be for 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope it will be a huge change that startles heaven, victory and triumphant return! </seg>

<seg id="5"> title: xu zhiyong: a letter to linyi city committee secretary li qun - gangster methods will hurt you </seg>
<seg id="6"> posting website: like old friends even though we just met (wed feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> as of yesterday, the linyi government that you lead has already illegally held chen guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> you have joined with the gangster underworld to illegally imprison a legal citizen who has been blind in both eyes for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> you cut the telephone line in his home, and installed cell phone disrupting equipment in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> you have also beaten up his family members on numerous occasions. </seg>
<seg id="11"> your barbaric actions have already passed beyond the bottom margin of civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> in october 2005 you used gangster methods to beat up me and lawyer li fangping, but we endured it, and always did our best to understand your difficulties, even tolerating you putting chen guangcheng under house arrest for a time. </seg>
<seg id="13"> however, 165 days have passed, and you have not constrained yourselves, and instead have become even more severe. </seg>
<seg id="14"> you send out large teams of police and gangsters to harass the village citizens. </seg>
<seg id="15"> you continue to arrest and beat up village citizens. </seg>
<seg id="16"> you have already gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> today, while you continue to organize gangsters to surround and block cheng guangcheng, i clearly remind you that gangster methods will in the end hurt yourself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> the beginning of the situation is worth your looking back and thinking about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> linyi's family planning is dead last for the entire province, </seg>
<seg id="20"> and as the secretary of the city committee, you being somewhat worried is understandable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> however, thinking that you can only use violence and force to implement national legal policies because linyi's citizens are unsophisticated is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="22"> citizens not cooperating with the behavior of the government, in the end whose fault is this? </seg>
<seg id="23"> is it because citizens are unsophisticated, or is it because the government has for a long time used lies and deceits leading to very low public confidence? </seg>
<seg id="24"> if you say that 10 years ago this kind of governmental behavior still didn't seem that preposterous; then in 2005, when chinese society has already had obvious improvements and human rights protection has already been added into the constitution, don't you think that your barbaric behavior is far off the mark? </seg>
<seg id="25"> why don't you think about it a bit?  why is it only you guys in linyi that still dare to do stuff like this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> how is it that you guys in linyi cannot use democratic and legal methods to enforce the law? </seg>
<seg id="27"> when chen guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported the facts of this barbaric enforcing of the law, through the involvement of teng biao and a group of lawyers bravely maintaining the rights of citizens and after the state family planning committee completed its investigations, linyi city could have heartily given an explanation and come to an understanding with the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> after all, family planning is a problem characteristic of china. </seg>
<seg id="29"> everybody could have understood and forgiven your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> however, you took further absurd actions - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back.  you also implicated him in the crime of illegally providing national confidential information. </seg>
<seg id="31"> don't you think that this crime is rather absurd for a blind person who lives in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> actually, you only need to correct your mistakes, you only need to do good.  do you really fear the criticism of a blind person? </seg>
<seg id="33"> do you really have to assign over 10 people to watch over him 24 hours a day and even try to pin utterly preposterous crimes onto him? </seg>
<seg id="34"> on october 4, 2005, lawyer li fangping and i went to the ancient village of dongshi where we expressed an extremely clear standpoint hoping to resolve this contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="35"> we suggested that we first talk with your officials, and see what ideas and demands you had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> we took the initiative and suggested we would help you persuade chen guangcheng not to say certain things. </seg>
<seg id="37"> we hoped that you wouldn't treat a blind person in such ways, and both parties should have concessions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> however, your decision maker insisted on doing things his own way and he even set up a "meticulous scheme" of his own - to beat us up and illegally detain us. </seg>
<seg id="39"> do you think you can frighten us into submission in this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> we have done nothing against the law, </seg>
<seg id="41"> we have no fear, </seg>
<seg id="42"> and although china's rule of law is not perfect, it is not that there is no law and no heaven above. </seg>
<seg id="43"> do you think you can frighten us into submission by using gangster methods?  then you have seriously underestimated our resolve and perseverance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> as long as we are willing, we have many people and many legal reasons to go to linyi, or go and see chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> you can beat up lawyer and scholar once, twice, three times; every time will be widely reported and paid attention to. </seg>
<seg id="46"> do you really dare to beat us 10 times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> are you not very concerned with your official post? </seg>
<seg id="48"> if there is anybody who is really hurt, is your official position that secure? </seg>
<seg id="49"> if you do not listen to our reasonable advice, and instead employ some low-level gangster methods, don't you think this is very dangerous and very foolish? </seg>
<seg id="50"> i want to clearly tell you that in china there are many outstanding citizens who obey the law and are true to their consciences. </seg>
<seg id="51"> we aren't afraid of the gangster underworld, </seg>
<seg id="52"> and we cannot abide the wanton trampling of the lowest margin of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> if you go too far, we will confidently and calmly face your clubs with group after group and go forward until you finally shrink back. </seg>
<seg id="54"> it should be clear to you, using gangster methods is nothing good for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> don't think that you can hide behind a curtain and be free of your relationship with those ruffian gangsters who beat up villagers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> in the end, i want to remind you, please be nice to chen guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="57"> this person who has been blind since childhood, graduated from the institute of chinese medicine, self-studied law and english, once sued beijing's subway company to get better benefits for the blind, brought running water to the villagers, and became the famous "lawyer chen" known near and far. </seg>
<seg id="58"> you went as far as using shameless persons to slander him on the internet, and also tried to frame him with the crime of illegally providing confidential information to foreigners.  don't you think that you have gone too far? </seg>
<seg id="59"> your house arrest of chen guangcheng is illegal, and is dangerous to you as well. </seg>
<seg id="60"> originally you could have released him, </seg>
<seg id="61"> and although your barbaric execution of the law would have stopped, even if he criticized you, how long could he go on? </seg>
<seg id="62"> instead, today you are continuing to further debase your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> as long as chen guangcheng does not get freedom, you will not get one day of rest. </seg>
<seg id="64"> your torture of him is already enough, </seg>
<seg id="65"> and if you still want to pin a crime on him or still want to utilize further gangster methods, we will definitely not stand to the side and just watch. </seg>

<seg id="2"> <poster> exploring china's peaceful path to liberation, pushing for the internal liberation of my countrymen. </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> i am extremely disappointed to admit: the chinese ethnicity does not deserve democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> aren't the people posting here doing just this thing! </seg>
<seg id="5"> it's just sad that people on the internet seeing this are not many (compared to 1.4 billion), </seg>
<seg id="6"> the number of people who are online and are concerned and take part in these types of subjects is even smaller: i am confident in asserting - they are less than 1% of those that use the internet! </seg>
<seg id="7"> and what about this internet having the largest, most comprehensive, most advanced, most expensive, and best security programs in the world! </seg>
<seg id="8"> indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> agony, disappointment, helplessness, even thinking of submission; but to live one's life, besides fighting yourself, who can you place hope on? </seg>
<seg id="10"> although the planning of affairs rests with man, to complete affairs rests with heaven. still, even if my plans do not succeed, if i do not work hard towards my ideals i will believe that i myself am wrong and deserve to live the life of a dog. </seg>
<seg id="11"> working hard towards righteousness, i will add some beauty to my life in this way alone, at least in my heart and in my appraisal of myself. </seg>
<seg id="12"> in fact, i don't need to be worried with china's future at all, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the world environment already cannot allow a regime that for a such a long time has not used elections. </seg>
<seg id="14"> it's only a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> it's just that i sigh that the chinese ethnicity is 'extremely lucky', we have always been put on a hellish path of torture and awfulness during the turns of history by world classed and superman classed monsters.  even though some call the high piles of bones and pools of blood this path extracts as glorious, and force us to be proud of our gloriousness. </seg>
<seg id="16"> dark nights are everywhere, china is endless. </seg>
<seg id="17"> with china's first emperor qinshihuang and confucius, the people violently died young. </seg>
<seg id="18"> qinshihuang was openly a tyrant, confucius brain washed covertly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> it's not that chinese are not deserving of democracy, it's that the genes of democracy have already been repressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> for a nation that has been around for three thousand years, if its ethnic culture had democratic genes, then this nation would have much earlier become a democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> when athens established a democratic system, when rome established a republic, when the english passed the magna carta, when the french published the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen, when americans published the declaration of independence, what were the chinese doing? </seg>
<seg id="22"> before the mongolians came into the central china plains, the mongols elected a leader at the kurultai, the manchurians had democratic discussions of government between the king and ministers, why is it when they came to the han region these tendencies were put out? </seg>
<seg id="23"> the chinese pursue material resources, and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual beliefs and political power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> i don't believe it.  if chinese had universal suffrage, they'd sell it for a salty pancake. </seg>
<seg id="25"> 500,000 years later, if the chinese want democracy, then there will certainly need to be an earthquake; those who can run, run! </seg>

<seg id="3"> special envoy of the dalai lama carries out closed meetings with chinese officials </seg>
<seg id="4"> the dalai lama has emphasized that he hopes tibet will be autonomous but not independent. </seg>
<seg id="5"> the special envoy of the dalai lama, exiled tibetan spiritual leader, is currently in beijing carrying out closed meetings with chinese officials, but the details have not been released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> this is the fifth formal meeting with the exiled government of the dalai lama since 2002 when china reinstated ties. </seg>
<seg id="7"> however, it's the same as before, both sides are carrying out closed meetings and the details have not been revealed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> reporters say that both sides have carried out multiple talks, but as of now they still do not have any results of real substance. </seg>
<seg id="9"> the dali lama, exiled in north india, said that he hopes for tibet to be autonomous, not independent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> china refused to comment on the two party talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> however, analysts say that beijing looks forward to the two party talks, some reasons being that it's worried if the 70 year old spiritual leader dies, it will likely lead to an increase of unsatisfactory sentiments of tibetans toward chinese rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> cultural identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> the delegation of the dali lama's exiled government are lead by kelsang gyaltsen.  he has also been the leading representative for the past several meetings. </seg>
<seg id="14"> the spokesperson for the tibet exiled government said that the several talks carried out with chinese officials in switzerland in 2005 were extremely "confidential and frank."  this brings hope to tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> the spokesperson said that their final hope is to reach a groundwork with the chinese leadership according to the talks, resolve relevant problems, allow tibetans to have freedom, and maintain their cultural identity which they believe is important. </seg>

<seg id="17"> special envoy of dali lama has repeated he does not seek independence </seg>
<seg id="18"> the dali lama will go to washington this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> before the dali lama, the tibetan spiritual leader, arrives in america on november 8, his special envoy expressed that the exiled tibetan government does not demand tibetan independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> kelsang gyaltsen said in washington that they hope the chinese government can indeed protect the unique culture and traditions of tibet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> it's predicted that when the dali lama visits america next week he will discuss the problem of tibet with president bush, and hope bush will urge the chinese government to give tibet true autonomous power. </seg>
<seg id="22"> the dali lama's representatives and beijing officials carried out direct contact this july in berne. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "true autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> kelsang gyaltsen pointed out that in the last several years the tibet exiled government and chinese authorities have see some positive aspects during talks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> the special envoy of the dali lama discovered that beijing leaders, especially representatives of the united front work department of cpc central committee were willing to listen to their viewpoints. </seg>
<seg id="26"> however, kelsang gyaltsen said that the tibet exiled government and the chinese government still had too many divergences, and the standpoint of both sides had too great a difference. </seg>
<seg id="27"> he said that in the last five years, the exiled tibetan government had already done all it could to respond to china's demand of creating a good environment for talks, </seg>
<seg id="28"> and china should also create a good environment for the tibet problem, and not just attack the dali lama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> he said that the dali lama does not demand tibetan independence, and tibet is a part of china, but the chinese government must protect the unique culture of tibet and "allow tibetans to truly have autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> besides this, kelsang gyaltsen pointed out that some chinese think that once the dali lama dies, the tibet problem will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> he said this way of thinking is extremely dangerous, because once the dali lama is not around, china will have lost a historic opportunity to resolve the tibet problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> he said that, as long as the chinese government is responsive to the demands brought up by the dali lama, and puts forth a final method of resolution, the dali lama will then not need to discuss the tibet problem in the international community. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <headline> negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy! (zt) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <poster>  hou ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> i just saw the post of an internet friend on "vast righteousness - give old mr. gui ren." </seg>
<seg id="4"> his (her) original words were: "negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy, otherwise democracy will fail because opinions are different and splits form!!!  this point should be amply paid attention to by those hoping for ideal democracy!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> these light and unflavorful words that did not stir any interest in my online friends got me thinking and lamenting. </seg>
<seg id="6"> at this time i wanted to go to ancient china, and i also wanted to go to the past of the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> i, who seldom post main threads, could not help but post a main thread to reply to this post of my online friend. </seg>
<seg id="8"> first let us look at ancient china. </seg>
<seg id="9"> everybody knows that china has been a centralized power since the first emperor, qinshihuang, established a unified china.  after that all dynasties operated under this governmental framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> although in the han period they implemented a "two track system" for a short time, it was just a governmental system of simultaneous operation of feudalist and central power mechanisms, and in the end central power won out. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the results of this type of central power system had its progressive side under the historic conditions of the time, and promoted the development of production capability. </seg>
<seg id="12"> however, we should see that the results of over two thousand years of operating under this system has lead to locations lacking the ingenuity, initiative, and pro-activeness they should have; and in no way could that system set various governing policies suitable for local development with actions that suit local situations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> a pyramid-like governing system also led to lower level officials only looking upward, in all respects taking orders from the next higher level. </seg>
<seg id="14"> because the local officials of county seats were all appointed by the central government,  there was no space for concessions and negotiations, and don't even bother to bring up the common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> when the rights of ancient chinese farmers were encroached on, they could only endure it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> only when their most basic rights were threatened - that is large scale starvation and the right of life being exploited by cruel government or natural disasters - would they raise up flags and resist. </seg>
<seg id="17"> over two thousand years numerous peasant rebellions have swept across the nation; from ones that had no forethought such as that led by chen sheng and wu guang to the planned yellow turban uprising, and again the huangchao violence of the tang dynasty, and the li zicheng uprising that ruled as a dynasty for one month.  except for zhu yuanzhang, all of these did not gain victory in the true meaning. </seg>
<seg id="18"> even the ming dynasty established by zhu yuanzhang was no more than the replacing of one dynasty with another, and there weren't changes in the system of government. </seg>
<seg id="19"> zhu yuanzhang, who was born a commoner and did not have much culture, took china's ancient centralized power system to an abnormal and extreme state, therein losing the vigorous and vital aspects of freedom and tolerance of the tang dynasty that system enjoyed, making the system inert. </seg>
<seg id="20"> any room for discussions of freedom disappeared on the chinese mainland, </seg>
<seg id="21"> the nature of humanity received the greatest suppression, </seg>
<seg id="22"> and everyone became overcautious, in awe and reverence of the government, and did not dare to say too much. </seg>
<seg id="23"> this was the aftermath of the only peasant rebellion that was successful in two thousand years, leaving the chinese people with a meager existence for a time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> now let's look at the middle ages that are called the dark ages in western europe. </seg>
<seg id="25"> western europe's middle ages was a thousand year era that took shape after western rome was destroyed by nomadic peoples.  these middle ages had no connection to ancient greece and rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> this era's main characteristic was feudalism, that is dividing up lands; </seg>
<seg id="27"> land was divided up further and further among lords and the lower levels had more self-governing rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> no matter if one was a small feudal lord of a few square kilometers of land, or a male aristocrat with a royal title; because those higher and lower could mutually balance, restrict, and rely on each other, they had the conditions and ability to strive for the rights they should have from their king.  this produced the situation of kings and aristocrats sitting together and carrying out negotiations for each one's benefits that was never seen in ancient china. </seg>
<seg id="29"> they made mutual concessions, and did not use violent methods to beat down and replace opponents. </seg>
<seg id="30"> in this way, by setting various contracts, power continuously was released into the hands of aristocrats and commoners, the rights of aristocrats and commoners became greater and greater, and the power of the king lesser and lesser. </seg>
<seg id="31"> until finally the english queen was just a empty position, and did not have any real power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> democracy was gradually realized in this way! </seg>
<seg id="33"> now look back and compare, in ancient china, where all power was concentrated in the hands of the emperor (except for li shimin of the tang dynasty) with almost no aristocrats, peasants could not easily enjoy a kettle of tea or cup of wine with them at the negotiating table, and mutually compromise in a relaxed and happy way to set up contracts with both sides happy. </seg>
<seg id="34"> under this situation, when the right to life was being exploited, they could only take up violent methods to topple the current dynasty, aiming to replace them. </seg>
<seg id="35"> the result was successive dynasties, from the high point of the tang dynasty to the abnormal situation of the ming dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> comparing chinese and western history, we learn there seems to be not one western country who in ancient times had such intensified contradictions between those in power and those ruled over as in china. </seg>
<seg id="37"> there is not one western country that was like ancient china and had endless peasant uprisings. </seg>
<seg id="38"> in western countries, when the ancient royal households and peasants had contradictions, the aristocrats and commoners appealing for their own benefits thought first to reach resolutions through the method of negotiations, and made some mutual concessions to gradually gain more rights.  only rarely did they take up the method of violence. </seg>
<seg id="39"> understanding from this, now that we have entered the 21st century, on the internet one can still see some fighters of democracy that have received the heritage of utterly absolutist totalitarianism thinking from the ming dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="40"> also because the poison of the cultural revolution has infested their bodies, these fighters of democracy only talk about overthrowing and toppling and nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="41"> these ideas are the biggest obstacles to democracy, because these people do not understand that negotiations and concessions are the most important method on the road to realizing democracy. </seg>

<seg id="5"> the author discovered in the village of a close friend and relative that in past years whenever this village celebrated spring festival, they would organize the villagers and put on a local play called "horse racing lantern," </seg>
<seg id="6"> this play uses characters from the three kingdoms period as its theme.  adults and children can all play a part in the game and the villagers never get tired of it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> this countryside has many troupes that performed "horse racing lantern," they would not only play in that village but also stroll to other villages; with these troupes coming and going, everything was quite lively. </seg>
<seg id="8"> but this year this village did not organize the play. </seg>
<seg id="9"> it turns out that just purchasing a costume for "horse racing lantern" costs a large amount of money.  in the past villagers would put together their money to buy costumes, and now these costumes are worn out to where they cannot be worn again. </seg>
<seg id="10"> the troupes went door to door asking villagers for a little money, but none of the folks were willing to give anything, and other villages of that countryside also had similar situations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> without "horse racing lantern," the village became cold and quiet all of a sudden; </seg>
<seg id="12"> adults began to play mahjong, </seg>
<seg id="13"> children began to play cards, </seg>
<seg id="14"> and all the villagers said this new year was boring. </seg>
<seg id="15"> setting off firecrackers and playing mahjong became the main scenes in the villages celebrating chinese new year. </seg>
<seg id="16"> the tendency of gambling is incessant despite repeated prohibitions, and tends to spread rampantly.  seeing losses and wins reaching over 10,000 rmb has become a common thing, especially for the large number of farmers returning from jobs in away from the countryside,  they have become the main characters seen at gambling halls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> the hard earned money from a year of work skips away so easily, </seg>
<seg id="18"> and family disputes brought about by gambling break out frequently; some even become tragedies with families falling apart or people dying. </seg>
<seg id="19"> some farmers say that they not only gamble during the chinese new year, but also participate in gambling when they are not farming; </seg>
<seg id="20"> if you don't gamble you have no place to go. </seg>
<seg id="21"> if you want to do some cultured activities in the village, finding "entertainment" is too hard; </seg>
<seg id="22"> not only does the village not have facilities and funds, there is no one to organize them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> in this aspect, there is no doubt that the practice of jiangxi province is a happy note for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> to enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses, jiangxi's provincial government began to implement the "government puts out money, the market operates it, villages and towns build stages, and farmers watch plays" policy since last september. </seg>
<seg id="25"> every year the government arranges at least 60 million rmb of special funds for the villages' cultural causes, sending excellent cultural products to the masses of the villages. </seg>
<seg id="26"> with the beginning of the chinese new year, the government put out another 40 million rmb, for a total of 100 million rmb of special funds to establish villages' cultural causes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> the things that have been bought with this special funding are fairly substantial: </seg>
<seg id="28"> the fund invites various professional cultural and arts performance groups to carry out performances in villages no less than four times every year in every countryside and town. </seg>
<seg id="29"> it invites all levels of movie companies to organize groups to come to villages and show movies - at least six story films or documentaries every year in every administrative village. </seg>
<seg id="30"> it organizes and opens up cultural activities for the masses that have local characteristics - at least two to three times each year for every countryside and town. </seg>
<seg id="31"> from this "shopping list", it's not hard for us to see that the government is not just putting out a bit of money and that's it, but is making painstaking efforts to figure out how to use limited funding to give cultural feasts that exceed the expected values for the vast number of farmers . </seg>
<seg id="32"> at present, there is not one of the vast number of farmers who is not ecstatically happy about being exempt from the "state grain tax." </seg>
<seg id="33"> if all governments could be like jiangxi's and "foot the bill" for cultural activities enriching the farmer masses, then this would be another joy for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> this "joy" would not only allow farmers to escape the mahjong table and become involved in cultural activities, it would also add "bricks and tiles" to the construction of socialist new villages. </seg>

<seg id="3"> wang peirong's child being kidnapped was a false alarm </seg>
<seg id="4"> at a little past 9:00 p.m. on january 24, 2006, wang peirong's child completely related the following: </seg>
<seg id="5"> on the morning of january 24, 2006 when wang peirong's child was making up for a missed physics class in xuzhou's number three high school, the gate guard called her out of class. </seg>
<seg id="6"> the gate guard said to the child that three males of unclear identification had said to the gate guard that because her mother and father were on bad terms, the child, wang tianjiao, had not returned home for three days. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "at present her mother was missing, and we are the managers of her mother's working unit, and would like to go into the number three high school and take the child with us." </seg>
<seg id="8"> she said to the gate guard that what these three men said was totally untrue, and would not agree to go with them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> with the help of the gate guard, the child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> wang peirong's child gave her mother's manager a telephone call to ask him to confirm this.  that manager said he did not send people to xuzhou's number three high school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> the child then called her father's manager. </seg>
<seg id="12"> when the child called her father's manager, </seg>
<seg id="13"> she said that there were three people that came to the number three high school to take her away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> that manager asked: "why didn't you go with them?" </seg>
<seg id="15"> she answered: "if i went with them i'd be dead." </seg>
<seg id="16"> after saying this the child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> listening to wang peirong's child relating this, one feels that the situation was serious and so wang peirong reported this to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> on january 25, the feedback information from the police station was that what was related by wang peirong's child was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> the police station asked the chinese university of mining's office of security if they sent people to the number three high school looking for wang peirong's child.  they answered they did not. </seg>
<seg id="20"> the police stations asked subordinate units of the chinese university of mining's office of security if they sent people to look for the child.  the answer once again was no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> relevant departments told wang peirong and her family to be careful of safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> after this incident, leaders of relevant departments of xuzhou were extremely concerned, </seg>
<seg id="23"> and through the detective department of xuzhou's ministry of public safety, they eliminated the likelihood of kidnapping the child. </seg>
<seg id="24"> wang peirong thanked leaders of relevant departments of xuzhou city and the detective department of xuzhou's ministry of public safety. </seg>
<seg id="25"> this was a false alarm, and the main reason for this false alarm was likely the gate guard of the number three high school. </seg>
<seg id="26"> the detective department of xuzhou's ministry of public safety now has investigated it clearly: on january 24, three managers of wang peirong from the college of science were urgently looking for wang peirong because they could not find her (as of now nobody knows what had happened to wang peirong), they thought to look for the teachers of wang peirong's child at the number three high school, and ask them if the child was in xuzhou or not. </seg>
<seg id="27"> a serious subject: why is the danger of being corrupt relatively low, and the cost of being anti-corrupt instead relatively high? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/readfile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> with the current cadre mechanisms and anti-greed mechanisms, what greedy officials need to worry about is managing those several related officials, and not the multitudes of the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> thus, as soon as he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or flattened out those several officials that effect his fate, then he can be at ease with his boldness and enjoy a great career of corrupt accumulation of wealth as his heart desires, and ignore the hardships of the masses surrounding him. </seg>
<seg id="31"> alternatively, if a ordinary person with no power sees injustice and comes out against corruption, he will likely bring about cruel attacks and retributions to himself, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or have a political collar placed around his neck, and be put in a position to die at any time before he is victorious. </seg>
<seg id="33"> comparing the two: the risk in being corrupt is relatively low, the cost of being anti-corrupt is relatively high. </seg>
