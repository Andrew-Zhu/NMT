<seg id="4"> china life insurance company's chief investment officer liu lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving, insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term.  this also means that insurance qdiis will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term.</seg>

<seg id="8"> however, given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present, china life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> according to a report by oecd, by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in germany will be gradually decreasing each year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> if there are not enough immigrants, the labor force in germany in 2020 will decrease by 6% as compared with the present.</seg>
<seg id="6"> however, reports by organizations such as the german employers association and the german association of engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in germany.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> it is stipulated in article 8 of the draft amendment of the lawyers law which has been recently submitted to the npc standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the state council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (june 28, the china youth daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> in the legal community there is a distinction between the "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  the former mainly includes the "abstract activities" such as teaching and researching laws, while the latter is more engaged in the "concrete activities" such as litigation, legal counseling, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for a long time there has existed a phenomenon of "scholars' mutual contempt" between the legal "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  the "theory circle" believes that the "practice circle" lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical "legalists," while the "practice circle" criticizes the "theory circle" by pointing out that "theory cannot direct practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> with regard to such a labor division, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party.</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" in the lawyers law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal "theory circle" is superior to the legal "practice circle."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> in fact, some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been.</seg>
<seg id="9"> thus, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" has doubtlessly opened up a "bad loophole" for confusing qualification in the legal "practice circle" which will have an extremely negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="10"> there is also more blind worship of the "theory circle" than these.  for example, the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship.</seg>

<seg id="6"> if it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts, then this example is indeed worth promoting.  if this is intended to "appeal" to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system, then it may be a bit naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out, we should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare: for example, promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes, reporting the status of employment, accepting regular reviews, etc.  on the other hand, the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> after all, only "withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law" is the long-term strategy.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10"> who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system?</seg>
<seg id="11"> as a level-one government organization, the neighborhood's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers' money?</seg>
<seg id="13"> on the one hand, households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be "self-sufficient;" on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for the welfare?</seg>

<seg id="1"> liu gangyi's remark about his willingness to be a service provider is more believable</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> on july 10, liu gangyi, the party committee secretary of mulan township, xindu district, chengdu city, who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country, received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office.  the rate of satisfaction reached 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> during his conversation with reporters, liu gangyi defined himself as a "service provider."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (yesterday, the beijing news)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the "service provider" as spoken by liu gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the "service provider" as spoken by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses, while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations.  and where the power originates determines that the former must take its  responsibility to the general public as top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> some people suspect that this kind of "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> my opinion is that it is better to have this form of "democratic evaluation" than nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="10"> considering the history and current status of china's grassroots democratic and political construction, i think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election.  being a major component of this innovation, the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> on june 23, patil brought her hands together palm to palm before she filled the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> india's presidential election kicked off on the 19th.  the new president will be chosen between the current vice president shekhawat and pratibha patil, who recently resigned as governor of rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="4"> patil is the first woman presidential candidate in the history of india.  if she is elected, she will become the first woman president ever in the indian history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> patil is the presidential candidate for the ruling party inc, while shekhawat is from the opposition party bjp.</seg>
<seg id="6"> since the inc occupies a dominant position in the presidential electoral college, the media and the general public all speculate that patil is rather likely to be elected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> patil, currently 72 years old, was a woman governor of rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> she was born into a lawyer's family and entered the parliament in 1985.  with rich experiences in politics, she was well acclaimed by the government during her tenure as governor of rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the honorary chairperson of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> analysts pointed out that the reason why patil became a candidate is because she has remained loyal to the inc president sonia gandhi.</seg>
<seg id="11"> in india the gandhi family has controlled the ruling inc party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> patil is supported and respected by a large number of female voters.  female voters believe that patil will reshape the image of women and raise the status of women in india, where discrimination against females is a dominant ideology.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13"> the constitution stipulates that india is a federal-system country .  the president is the nominal head of state and commander of the armed forces, representing no party organization and serving more as a symbol.</seg>

<seg id="3"> this rich echo of history connected the mainland and hong kong via television, as the citizens of nanjing and hong kong compatriots "shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth" and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of hong kong's reversion to the motherland.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> ten years previously, at 12:00 a.m. on july 1, the sound of the tolling of the eternal warning bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the memorial hall of nanjing's jinghai temple, bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of hong kong island.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> an official in the us department of defense said on the 23rd that due to the iraq war and changes in the world situation, the us department of defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of us troops in europe by approximately half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> the us media cited a department of defense official as saying that due to the ongoing iraq war and the worsening us relations with russia and iran, department of defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> in 2002 the then secretary of defense rumsfield announced that the us would reduce troop numbers in europe from the original 113,000 to 71,000 before 2012, in order to create a new-style army with "fewer, but better" soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the us army's total forces in europe have currently fallen to 100,000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> but in june this year, commander craddock of the us army headquarters in europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense, gates, raising doubts over the above-mentioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the report said that while us army forces are being reduced in europe, many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to iraq and afghanistan for combat, leading to a shortfall in us troops in europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with european allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the report recommended halting the plan to reduce us troops in europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> relevant us experts believe that the above-mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved iraq war has disrupted the original us military's restructuring plans.</seg>

<seg id="1"> three main functions of modern military uniform</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> the first is the identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> it is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries, different military services, and between the military and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> in the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world, although the use of military uniform is basically identical, there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the second is the symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> to a certain extent, military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics, and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire, everyday uniforms, and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> the third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> with the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry, improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing, stealth protection, anti-chemical, anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions, as well as control of the temperature, humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform.</seg>

<seg id="3"> report by qu yimao and yang ruiyu: "we can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments."</seg>
<seg id="4"> today, more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in chengdu military command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments.  they felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the "group" on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> over the past few years, along with the replacement of personnel, an excessive part of the brigade's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations, making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty.  officers and men had quite strong views about this.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times, but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction, allowing the problem to become a long-standing, big and difficult issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "as long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable, there are no difficulties we cannot solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> after the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus, the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> on the one hand they appealed to people's emotions and explained their reasoning, hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture; on the other hand, they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments, apartments built with pooled money, and economical and adequate apartments, to show the party committee's staunch determination and principled stance.</seg>
<seg id="10"> in the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied, the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army.</seg>
<seg id="11"> over two months of meticulous work, all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule, and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> the way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction.  several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization's decisions.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> staff writer, report by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin: on june 18, at a training class for people's armed force full-time cadres in jingjiang city in jiangsu province, lu yuqing, leader of the people's armed force department of xilai township, delivered a training lecture "winning a psychological war under informationalized conditions" that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this was a new change that was brought about by the city's people's armed force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise people's armed force cadres' comprehensive quality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> at the beginning of this year, the people's armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the people's armed force cadres had served for a long time, had too many concurrent duties, and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for this reason, they have adopted methods including centralized training, replacing training with meetings, and relying on local party schools to conduct training, thus regularly training military cadres, in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in combination with the central work, they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them, and raise their performance by on-the-job training.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the same time, they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the "people's armed forces cadres' competition for jobs scheme," and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of people's armed forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8"> they have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots people's armed forces work, and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the people's militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the new century shipbuilding company limited, chen yisong, who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader.</seg>

<seg id="2"> judging simply from the result of the match, 2-2 seems a reasonable score, and is also one that the chinese team can accept.  the key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> if the iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead, then the chinese team had evened up the score, then the feeling that would have given china's sports fans would certainly have been different.  it would have boosted morale.  the pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> you could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the chinese team often don't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance, and most people's view is that the psychological quality of china's players is not really up to it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> this is actually one reason why the chinese team cannot "finish well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, judging by the chinese team's match today, it may not be quite so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> even if we set aside the fact that sun jihai, sun xiang, shao jiayi, zheng zhi and others have played in europe, li weifeng and others are also old-timers with long experience of the battlefield.  they have experience and knowledge, and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the reason why the chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match.</seg>
<seg id="10"> when the iranian team were behind, they substituted two persons, and the scene immediately seemed different.</seg>
<seg id="11"> in the second half, the chinese team also substituted three players, but without a positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> to overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well, it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> as long as the problem is correctly grasped, it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "small, scattered, far and direct" education coordination zones go into operation in a second artillery unit base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> staff writer, report by xue bingjian and correspondent xu yeqing: the situation in the "small, scattered, far and direct" units where education organization is difficult, resources are meager, and each fends for itself, will become history at a second artillery unit base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project, this base has handed down "the method of fully implementing 'an outline for ideological and political education'."  a number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the "small, scattered, far and direct" units in the base have officially been brought into operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> in order to push ahead with the effective implementation of "an outline for ideological and political education," the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in "small, scattered, far and direct" units.  they combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time, personnel and results, and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the "small, scattered, far and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the "small, scattered, far and direct" units are relatively concentrated, and conduct an integrated program for thematic education, with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> they have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts, and unifying the allocation of educational resources.  in each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated, and each unit's materials, data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others, with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men.</seg>
<seg id="7"> every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> on this basis, each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues, holding joint discussions on major educational themes, reporting critical ideological situations, and assessing tests and evaluations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> zhang shengmin, the director of the base's political department, told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content, out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in this way, the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated.</seg>

<seg id="1"> doing things openly in a ji'nan military command unit takes heat off "hot-button issues"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> staff writer</seg>
<seg id="3"> report by wang weiqin and specially contracted correspondent li deying: on july 25, this writer observed in a service support company of the ji'nan military command that invitations for an army engineering tender, details of financial expenditure, promotions of cadres, non-commissioned officers being admitted to the party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board, and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="4"> as political commissar su chengsen explained, this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> at the beginning of this year, the unit party committee drew up measures including "two-way supervision between the organization and the grassroots" and "publicizing sensitive issues" to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government, requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development, the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached, and that standards, procedures, and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board, and has opened a "message board" on its intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the beginning of the year, as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start, before the work began, the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men, and then released the information on inviting bids, implementing a system of open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this both saved money and won the support of the officers and men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> in this unit, the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices, no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of "hot-button" sensitive matters, or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts, thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> xinhua news agency, maracaibo (venezuela) july 3 (correspondent liu jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> according to a report in the venezuelan media on the 3rd, the us team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper, keller, said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the america's cup, then he would opt to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "if i have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the america's cup, then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> with the relegation of the m枚chengladbach team to the 2nd bundesliga, keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> although keller has a mind to retire, he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place.  he himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the spanish primera liga, the english premiership, and the german bundesliga, said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family.  "my kid is already 9 years old.  he has followed me around and stayed in three different countries, and has been to three different schools, and so i need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the gold cup competition that was concluded not long ago, keller put in an outstanding performance, helping the us team to win the title.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in the current america's cup, he has, just as before, been given an important job to do by head coach bradley, but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded.  the us team, made up of "young guards," is no match for such strong south american opponents as argentina and paraguay, and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the next match against colombia will probably be the us team's and keller's last performance in this america's cup competition.</seg>

<seg id="3"> after the hearing, the official fia website issued a statement saying, "the vodafone mclaren mercedes team was in possession of confidential ferrari information, but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the fia formula one world championship.  we'll therefore impose no penalty."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> chinanews.com, july 31 - on the 30th, chen shuibian questioned an attempt by the island's judicial personnel to interfere with the election of the taiwan region's leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> taiwan's "department of judicial administration director-general" kao chin-chih said on the same day that the current performance of the island's judges does not match what chen shuibian said, and requested that chen shuibian explain what he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to a report from taiwan's united daily news, on the 30th chen shuibian questioned interference, influence, and even attempts to control the election activities of the various parties' candidates, due to political factors or election considerations, by judges, public prosecutors, or investigators.  he claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in taiwan, but that it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> in response to chen shuibian's questioning, taiwanese "judicial yuan president" weng yueh-sheng kept a low profile and did not respond.  "secretary-general" fan kuang-chun, on the other hand, assigned kao chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "judicial yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> kao chin-chih said that both the taiwanese constitution and the "judges' rules" proclaim in writing that judges must be nonpartisan, cannot participate in political party activities, and cannot assist in elections; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully.  the "judicial yuan" believes the judges are all doing a good job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> kao chin-chih gave an example, noting that judge jang shenq-shii of kaohsiung "branch high court" participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the ketagalan school, and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party.  the punishment resolution was by a self-disciplinary committee composed of judges.</seg>
<seg id="8"> jang shenq-shii once wanted to take part in dpp primary elections, and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> kao chin-chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief, it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> staff report, berlin, july 1 (correspondent wang huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> german education and research minister schavan said a few days ago that germany should lower the immigration law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers, using an introduction of foreign talent to solve germany's specialized skilled worker shortage problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to an oecd report, by 2010, germany's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly.</seg>
<seg id="5"> without enough immigrants, germany's labor force by 2020 will be 6% smaller than now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> however, reports from organizations such as the federation of german employers' associations and the association for german engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current german labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> according to data from the german federal labor agency, the german labor market had a supply shortage of about 12,700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9,600 technicians in may of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8"> germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> germany's immigration law states that specialized skilled workers from non-eu countries cannot earn less than 85,500 euros per year in germany, or else cannot obtain german work and residency permits.</seg>
<seg id="10"> schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2"> clause 8 of the revised draft of the law on lawyers, which was recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people's congress for review, states: those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high-level title or the equivalent, upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the state council's judicial administrative department.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (june 28, china youth daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> in law, there is the "theoretical field" and the "practical field."  the former mainly includes "abstract actions" such as legal teaching and research work, while the latter undertakes more "concrete actions" such as litigation, legal consultation, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for a long time, "intellectual disparagement" has existed between the "theoretical field" and "practical field" of law.  the "theoretical field" thinks that the "practical field" lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical "legalists"; meanwhile, the response of the "practical field" to criticism by the "theoretical field" is "theory cannot guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> concerning this kind of division of labor gap, what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side.</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, the "specially licensed lawyer system" in the law on lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law's "theoretical field" is above the law's "practical field."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> the fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory, such as history of the legal system and international law, do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in this way, for the law's "practical field," the "specially licensed lawyer system" no doubt opens a "bad door" which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> an assistant director of the jianguomen neighborhood said, "in light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances, encouraging the self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families."</seg>
<seg id="6"> this example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one's own hard work; it is really somewhat na茂ve if it is thought this will "inspire" those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="7"> when differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances: such as immediately reporting changes in family members' incomes, reporting employment situation, and accepting regular reviews.  meanwhile, relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in the end, "exit from subsistence allowance according to the law" is the long-term solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance?</seg>
<seg id="11"> as a first-level governmental organization, a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, should this taxpayer money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> on the one hand, families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain "self-sufficient" capacity; on the other hand, aren't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances?</seg>

<seg id="1"> optimism in india for electing first female president; analysts claim relatively high possibility of election victory; female voters hope this improves status of women</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> on june 23, patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> india's presidential election kicked off on the 19th, with the new president to be elected from between shekhawat, the current vice president, and pratibha patil, the recently resigned governor of rajasthan state.</seg>
<seg id="4"> patil is the first female presidential candidate in the history of india.  if she is elected, she will become the first female president in india's history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> patil is the presidential candidate for the governing congress party, whereas shekhawat comes from the opposition bharatiya janata party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> since the congress party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college, the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a patil victory is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> patil, who is 72 years old this year, was rajasthan's female governor.</seg>
<seg id="8"> she started out as a lawyer, entering parliament in 1985.  with abundant political work experience, she received high opinions from the government when governor of rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> she has also dedicated herself for social welfare, as honorary chairwoman for many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> analysts note that patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to sonia ghandi, president of india's congress party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> in india, the ghandi family has been controlling the governing congress party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> patil has received many female voters' support.  female voters believe that in india where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women, patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> the constitution stipulates that the president of india, a federal country, is the country's leader and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in name, without representing any party or organization.  it is more of a symbol.</seg>

<seg id="4"> among the armies of over 100 large and small nations in the world, although the basic use of a military uniform is the same, the military uniforms of no two countries' armies are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> two, symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> to a certain degree, a military uniform is the image of a nation's spirit, a reflection of its national characteristics, and is a focused embodiment of a nation's military capability and its soldiers' accomplishments.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in the three main categories of military uniform: ceremonial uniform, service uniform and training uniform, nothing is more capable of fully displaying national and military prestige than a stiff and tight-fitted, handsome-looking ceremonial uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> three, protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> with the rapid development of new high-technology weapons, improving the overall protective performance of new types of training uniform and making military uniform bullet proof, detection proof, chemical proof, germ proof, radiation proof, as well as having temperature control, moisture control, gas control and various other functions, has become the foremost issue in military uniform development.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> staff report, chengdu, july 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> report by qu yimao and yang ruiyu: "we are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the battalion party committee to clear out the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="4"> today, more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in chengdu military command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block .  they are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which "the team" of the battalion party committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> in the last few years, as personnel have been replaced, a portion of this battalion's apartments in this family dormitory building was over-occupied, contrary to regulations, which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation.  officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before, but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled, which turned this issue into a long-standing problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "if only one sticks to one's guns and is fair and reasonable, there are no unsolvable problems."</seg>
<seg id="8"> after the new party committee team achieved consensus, major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> on the one hand, they appealed to people's emotion and explained through reason, hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments, pooled housing and economic housing, and made clear the party committee's determination, resolve and standpoint on principles.</seg>
<seg id="10"> for some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over-occupied housing, the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army's work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> after two months of painstaking work, all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over-occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> this style in which the battalion party committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect: a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allocation, now also, one by one, expressed submission to the organization's decision.</seg>

<seg id="1"> jingjiang city people's armed forces department builds platform to improve quality of their full-time cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> staff report by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin: on june 18, in a class where jiangsu province jingjiang city people's armed forces full-time cadres assembled for training, a tutorial course on "winning the psychological war under informationalized conditions" taught by lu yuqing, director of the people's armed forces department from xilai town, received unanimous acclaim from participating students.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this is a new change achieved by the people's armed force department of this city through giving their full-time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> at the beginning of this year, during a grassroots survey, this people's armed forces department party committee discovered that some full-time cadres have worked for a long number of years, held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing people's armed forces work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for this reason, they adopted centralized training, held meetings instead of lectures, relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods, and periodically carried out training for full-time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full-time cadres' narrow sphere of knowledge, singular professional capability, etc.</seg>
<seg id="6"> based on core work, they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on people's armed forces full-time cadres, and through on-the-job training improved their work competence.</seg>
<seg id="7"> meanwhile, they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the "people's armed forces full-time cadre achieving position through competition plan."  this clarifies the regulation that the director of the people's armed forces department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices.</seg>
<seg id="8"> a full-time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full-time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots people's armed forces work, while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, chen yisong, the secretary in charge of the people's armed forces department at new century shipyard ltd., led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation.  he was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company's people's armed forces department.</seg>

<seg id="1"> if you start well, you should finish well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> simply speaking from the match result, a 2-2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the chinese team.  the key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="3"> if iran was in the lead 2-0 and then china came back to even the score, the impression given to chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot.  what a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> one could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable, and the view of the average person is that the chinese players are mentally not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> indeed, this is one of the reasons china is incapable of "finishing well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, looking at china's match tonight, this does not necessarily seem to be the case.</seg>
<seg id="8"> not mentioning sun jihai, sun xiang, shao jiayi, zhen zhi and others who played soccer in europe before, li weifeng and others are also old war veterans.  they have extensive experience and, logically speaking, should not have any problems pschologically.</seg>
<seg id="9"> regretfully, this chinese team was held to a draw by iran, and i am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle.</seg>
<seg id="10"> while lagging behind, iran substituted two people, and the scene immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> china also substituted three players in the second half, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> to overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well, they must correctly determine the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> as long as the problem can be correctly determined, it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> what they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation.</seg>
<seg id="15"> if they continue this way, no matter how many matches the chinese team play, they will continue to repeat their old problem.  this is a far cry from everyone's expectation to see them improve with each match they play.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> staff report by xue bingjian and correspondent xu yeqing: the phenomenon of difficult organization, few resources, and individual operation in educating the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units will become a thing of the past at a second artillery base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> in recent days, this reporter learned that after half a year of trials, this base issued "methods of implementing the 'ideological and political education syllabus'" to the grassroots levels.  a number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base were officially set in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> to promote effective implementation of the "ideological and political education syllabus," at the beginning of the year, this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base.  they combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time, staff and effectiveness, and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for "small, scattered, remote and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries, specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated "small, scattered, remote and direct" units in unified planning of topical education.  units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> a combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength.  educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly; and the information, data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged.  typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized, and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned.</seg>
<seg id="7"> each coordination section has established a full-time education liaison and a part-time educational information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> on this basis, each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems, discuss important educational subject matters, report urgent ideological situations, and to test and appraise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> director of the political department at the base, zhang shengmin, told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources, but has also deepened the effect of the education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units, so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in so doing, the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> at the beginning of this year, this army party committee formulated the "office and grassroots bidirectional supervision," "public notices of sensitive issue," and other measures to strengthen the building of party conduct and clean government.  these require that important issues involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers and army construction are only decided after listening to the opinion of grassroots officers and soldiers.  also, depending upon the situation, the entire process of office standards, procedures, results, etc. are made public.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the army set up a suggestion box and notice board, opened up a "message board" on their intranet and extensively collected everybody's opinions and suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the beginning of the year, the soldier's dormitory refurbishment project started.  before work got underway, the party committee extensively solicited opinion from officers and soldiers, and then issued a public tender notice and carried out public tender bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this both saved expenditures and won the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="9"> conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level.</seg>
<seg id="10"> in this army, whether it is settling upon work as large as 'hot issue' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one's relatives, the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items, the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications, and take the initiative to accept mass supervision.</seg>

<seg id="7"> yet this veteran goalkeeping idol, who has served in the spanish primera league, the english premier division, and german bundesliga 1, expressed that how he finally decides, depends upon his family, "my child is already 9 years old, he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools.  my choice now must consider how to better benefit my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the gold cup that ended not long ago, keller performed outstandingly and helped the us team capture the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in the current america cup, he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach bradley, but what can one man do against overwhelming odds; a us team of "elite young guards" setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such south american giants as argentina and paraguay.  in these two matches, the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times.</seg>

<seg id="3"> (june 28, china youth daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> there are "theorists" and "practitioners" in law, where the former primarily involve "abstract behaviors" such as legal teaching and research, while the latter are more of "concrete behaviors" such as litigations, legal counseling and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for a long time, there has been mutual contempt between legal "theorists" and "practitioners." "theorists" think "practitioners" are merely mechanical "legal dogmatists" lacking necessary attainments in the science of law, while criticisms of "practitioners" about "theorists" are directed at the "inability of theories to guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> given such gap in the division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral rather than strongly support either of the two.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> in reality, for some experts and scholars who study and teach pure legal theories such as the legal history and international law, no matter how profound and sophisticated their theories are, they are incompatible with legal practice.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> the author is happy for these households for the improvement in their living, but has mixed feelings towards the term "opting out of the minimum living standard scheme" and the practice of "awarding."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "regarding problems such as cheating on the minimum living allowance, encouraging people to opt out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances," deputy director at the jianguomen subdistrict office said.</seg>
<seg id="6"> such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts; they are, however, a bit naive if the purpose is to "move" those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance: for example, informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner, reporting the employment situation, undergoing regular reviews etc. and competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> after all, "withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursuant to law" is the permanent solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> who will pay for the in-kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme?</seg>
<seg id="11"> as a level of governmental organizations, the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> on the one hand, by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme, the households prove to have certain capacity to "sustain themselves;" on the other hand, aren't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance?</seg>

<seg id="1"> three major functions of modern military uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> first is the identifying function,</seg>
<seg id="3"> an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations, among different armed services, and between troops and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world, no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> second is the symbolizing function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> to some extent, military uniforms not only reflect a country's vitality and national characteristics, but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country's armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="7"> of the three major categories of military uniforms, dress uniforms, service uniforms and combat & training uniforms, nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the neat and elegant dress uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> with the rapid development of new and high-tech weapons, it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat & training uniforms, so that military uniforms have various functions, such as protecting from bullets, reconnaissance, chemistry, bacteria and radiation, as well as conditioning the temperature, humidity and air.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> chengdu, july 3, by the newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> by qu yimao and yang ruiyu: "the fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion's party committee office to vacate houses."</seg>
<seg id="4"> today, more than ten cadres of a communications training battalion at the chengdu military region who moved into apartments were all lit up with pleasure, as they were filled with admiration and gratitude for the working style of the "team" at the battalion's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thorny problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> a few years earlier, with staff changing and being replaced, some homes in the battalion's family dormitory building were over-occupied in violation of rules, which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service. both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times, but left it unsettled because of various resistance, making this problem a hard nut to crack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "so long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable, there are no difficult problems that we can't solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> once the new party committee reached the consensus, principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> they touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand, hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective; on the other hand, they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments, pool funded housing and economically affordable housing, expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the party committee.</seg>
<seg id="10"> for those people who had housing elsewhere, but were reluctant to return the over-occupied housing, the party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops' work on voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="11"> after two months of attentive efforts, all tenants in the barrack complex who over-occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule, and the battalion's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> the working style of the battalion's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects, in that several cadres who were previously reluctant to give active cooperation in the organization's allocation have now said they would follow the organization's decisions.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin, pla daily: on june 18, at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of jingjiang, jiangsu province, the lecture win the psychological warfare in the context of informationization by lu yuqing, director of the xilai town department of people's armed force, received positive comments amongst all participants.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this was a fresh change as a result of the city's department of people's armed force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> at the beginning of this year, when doing grassroot research, the party committee of the department of people's armed force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties.</seg>
<seg id="5"> therefore, they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training, meeting as a way of training, relying on local party school to provide training, with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in line with the core responsibilities, it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on-the-job practice.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in addition, by actively coordinating with local organization departments, they jointly formulated the scheme of position competitions amongst armed force cadres, which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs;</seg>
<seg id="8"> and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres, whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion, while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted.</seg>
<seg id="9"> recently, chen yisong, a clerk of the armed force department at the new century shipbuilding co., ltd., who led a militia technical unit to fill a void of the nation with their innovatively developed underwater ship welding technique, was promoted to the company's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> solely from the result of the game, a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the chinese team. what's essential is the process of the game, which is somewhat disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="3"> if it was the iranian team who led 2-0 before the chinese team equalized the score, this would definitely give chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale. unfortunately, things were just the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> a good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances. the conventional view is that chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="6"> this is indeed a reason why the chinese team could not have a "good ending."</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, seen from today's game of the chinese team, it seems this is not completely true.</seg>
<seg id="8"> people like li weifeng are experienced veteran players, let alone people like sun jihai, sun xiang, shao jiayi and zheng zhi who have played soccer in europe. they have broad experience and knowledge, and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the iranian team this time, most probably because of improper deployment of players.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the chinese team also substituted with three players, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> to overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending, the source of the problem must be spotted.</seg>
<seg id="13"> as long as the problem is spotted, it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> what we fear is to see a doctor indiscriminately in case of an emergency disease.</seg>
<seg id="15"> if things go on like that, the chronic problem will persist no matter how many games the chinese team plays, not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> by xue bingjian and reporter xu yeqing, pla daily: the phenomenon where education at small, dispersed, remote and direct (sdrd) units is hard to organize, lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the second artillery force.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the reporters learned recently that after a six-month pilot project, the base handed down steps to implement "ideological and political education outline" and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its sdrd units have officially begun operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> to promote effective implementation of the ideological and political education outline, the base organized efforts to perform in-depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at sdrd units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time, people and effects of the education, creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for sdrd units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the sdrd units are relatively concentrated, designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator, which will conduct centralized planning of theme education. units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems.</seg>
<seg id="6"> education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner, information and data, as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged, report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly, and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study.</seg>
<seg id="7"> each collaboration area has put in place a full-time education contact and a part-time education information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> building on this, the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems, joint consultations on major educational topics, emergency briefing of ideological situations, and that of assessment and evaluation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> zhang shengmin, director of the base's political department, told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources, but also deepened the effects of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units.</seg>
<seg id="11"> officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught, for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> as such, passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired.</seg>

<seg id="1"> bian secretly criticizes judicial invention in election, taiwan's "judicial yuan" denies, demands explanation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> chinanews.com, july 31 - chen shui-bian on the 30th raised doubts about attempts of judicial members in the island to intervene in the election of taiwan regional leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> kao chin-chih, "director-general of the department of judicial administration" in taiwan, stated on the same day that judges in the island are behaving differently from what chen shui-bian described and demanded an explanation from chen shui-bian for his remark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to report of the united daily news of taiwan, chen shui-bian raised doubts about judges, prosecutors, and investigators intervened, influenced, and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections. he claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in taiwan but it may be extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> in response to the doubt of chen shui-bian, weng yueh-sheng, "president of the judicial yuan" in taiwan maintained a low-key and did not respond while "secretary-general" fan kuang-chun appointed kao chin-chih to speak for the judicial yuan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> kao chin-chih stated that the fundamental law of taiwan and the "judges' rules and regulations" both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups. they cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign. judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously. the judicial yuan believed that all judges have done well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> kao chin-chih quoted an example by saying that chang sheng-hsi, judge of the "kaohsiung branch of the supreme court", took part in the course offered by the ketagalan institute a few years ago. since the related course had party flavor, the self-disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him.</seg>
<seg id="8"> chang sheng-hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the democratic progressive party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office, he finally decided to give up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> kao chin-chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case, one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance. one cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> this newspaper, berlin, july 1, (reporter wang huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> schavan, german minister of education and research, said a few days ago that germany should lower the restrictions on the importation of foreign professionals in the immigration law to resolve the shortage of professionals in germany through an increase in the importation of foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> according to the report of the organization for economic cooperation and development, the size of labor force between the age of 15 and 64 in germany will drop every year till 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5"> if there are insufficient immigrants, germany's labor force in 2020 will be 6 percent smaller than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> however, reports of organizations including the confederation of german employers' associations and the association of german engineers showed that in current german labor market, the shortages in engineers and skilled technicalprofessionals are bigger.</seg>
<seg id="7"> according to data from the german federal labor office, as of this may, there was a shortage of approximately 12,700 people in the supply of engineers and a shortage of 9,600 people in the supply of technicians in the german labor market.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in order to protect the employment of its nationals, germany has set a rather high threshold for the importation of foreign talents.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the german immigration law stipulates that the annual salaries of professionals from non-eu countries must not be lower than 85,500 euros, otherwise they will not be able to obtain a work and residence permit in germany.</seg>
<seg id="10"> schavan suggested lower this limit to 40,000 to 60,000 euros.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> article 8 of the draft amendment of the law on lawyers recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people's congress for deliberation stipulates: people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law, with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence, may obtain a lawyer's license, and get approval from judicial departments under the state council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (june 28, china youth daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> there is a difference between the "theoretical circle" and the "practical circle" in law. the former mainly includes "abstract behaviors" such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more "concrete behaviors" such as engaging in litigations, legal consultations, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the phenomenon of "scorning of each other" has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law. the theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical "legalist" while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that "theories cannot guide practice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> in regards to such a divergence of division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness.</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, the "chartered lawyer system" in the law on lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> in fact, for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws, no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories, they will still be out of step with practical legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in this case, chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a "bad precedent" with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these. for instance, expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts. this phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> the jianguomen neighborhood office in dongcheng district, beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low-income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily  surrendered their low-income subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (the beijing news, july 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> the author is happy about the improvements in life of these families. however, i have mixed feelings about the wording of "voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy" and the practice of "giving out rewards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> vice-chairman of jianguomen neighborhood office said, "in order to address problems including defrauding low-income subsidy and so on, encouraging voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy is to set an example for other low-income subsidy recipient households."</seg>
<seg id="6"> if this example encourages other low-income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own, then it is indeed worth promoting. however, if one wants to use this to "inspire" people who have been defrauding low-income subsidy for a long time, then it is somewhat naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low-income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low-income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low-income subsidy: for example, inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner, report employment situation, and subjected to regular review. meanwhile, relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> after all, only the "surrender of low-income subsidy according to the law" is the long-term plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low-income subsidies by the neighborhood office?</seg>
<seg id="11"> as a level-one government agency, the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> then, should this sum of taxpayers' money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> on the one hand, families that surrender their low-income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self-sufficient". on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for low-income subsidy?</seg>
<seg id="14"> government appropriation that is labeled as life-saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> the "one who serves others" that liu gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than "the one who serves others" referred to by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher-level organizations, whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> some people challenge that such a "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show".</seg>
<seg id="9"> my opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any.</seg>
<seg id="10"> given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in china, i believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough. democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking. it should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level.</seg>

<seg id="1"> people's armed forces department of jingjiang city builds platform to elevate qualities of people's armed forces cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> this newspaper, reported by staff reporters cao jiawei, zhu chunbin: on june 18, in the training class for cadres of the department of people's armed forces in jingjiang city, jiangsu province, the tutorial to win the psychological battle under information conditions taught by lu yuqing, chief of the xilai county department of people's armed forces, was well received by all students taking part in the training.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this was the new change brought about by the concentrated effort of the city's department of people's armed forces to elevate the comprehensive qualities of the cadres of the department of people's armed forces through charging them with heavy tasks in accordance with reality of their positions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> in the beginning of the year, during grassroots research, the party committee of the department of people's armed forces found that some cadres of the people's armed forces had long term of service and held too many concurrent duties, thus failed to focus their energy on doing armed forces work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> to this end, they adopted measures including centralized training, coaching seminars, and reliance on training offered by local party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the department of people's armed forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one-dimensional professional qualifications of the cadres of the department of people's armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="6"> they integrated central tasks and boldly assigned duties to cadres of the department of people's armed forces, charged them with heavy tasks, and elevated their work abilities through on-the-job training.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the same time, they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the program for cadres of the department of people's armed forces to compete for job positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the department of armed forces must join the team of party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties;</seg>
<seg id="8"> they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the department of people's armed forces. for cadres of the department of people's armed forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work, they made adjustments and exchanges immediately. for compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities, they promoted and employed them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, chen yisong, secretary of the new century shipbuilding co., ltd. department of people's armed forces, led the technical detachment of the militiamen in the innovative development of underwater ship welding technology that filled the gap in the country. he was promoted to the chief of the company's department of people's armed forces as an exception.</seg>

<seg id="1"> good start still needs to see things through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> the 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone. the key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="3"> if the iranian team led by 2-0, then the chinese team tied the score, that would definitely make chinese fans feel very differently. it would bolster a lot of morale. unfortunately, the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation. the general opinion is that mentally chinese players are not tough enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> this is indeed a reason that the chinese team fails to "see things through".</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, judging from the game that the chinese team played today, it seems that it is not necessarily so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> not only had sun jihai, sun xiang, shao jiayi, and zheng zhi played in europe before, li weifeng and the others are also battle-hardened veterans. they are experienced and knowledgeable. theoretically, there should not be any problem with their mental qualities.</seg>
<seg id="9"> this time, the chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the iranian team. the reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> in order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through, one must find the root of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> as long as one identifies the problem, means to resolve it is probably not hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="15"> if the situation continues like this, no matter how many more games the chinese team plays, it will still commit the same mistake. the continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question.</seg>

<seg id="2"> this newspaper, reported by xue bingjian, reporter xu yeqing: the phenomena of difficult organization, limited resources, and lack of coordination in education encountered by small, scattered, remote, and independent units will become history for a base of the second artillery.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot, the base promulgated the enactment measures to implement ideological and political education syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small, scattered, remote, and independent units at the base. the measures are officially in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> in order to promote the effective implementation of the ideological and political education syllabus, the base allocated resources to conduct an in-depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small, scattered, remote, and independent units in the beginning of the year. they sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time, personnel, and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small, scattered, remote, and independent units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> the details of the cooperation zones are, break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units, and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub-area where small, scattered, remote, and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education. units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long-distance discussions by means of video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> they adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force. education hardware in the sub-area is put under centralized use. information and data of all units, as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged. report tours by model sub-areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized.</seg>
<seg id="7"> each cooperation unit has set up full-time education contacts and part-time education information gatherers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> on this foundation, all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions, discussions on major educational topics, notification of emergency ideological situations, and examination and assessment.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> zhang shengmin, chief of the political department at the base, told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects.</seg>
<seg id="10"> some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units, so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion, differentiation, and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in this case, the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated.</seg>

<seg id="4"> "if four or six weeks after the copa america ends i still can't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice."</seg>

<seg id="7"> however, the veteran goalkeeper, who had played in the spain's first division league, the english premier league, and the germany's first division league, stated that his final decision rests on his family, "my child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools. my choice now must seek what's the best for my family."</seg>

<seg id="8"> he stated that south korea should take military measures now to guarantee north korean civilian ships' direct sailing from the haeju port down south and their full passage through jeju strait.</seg>
<seg id="9"> this was the second work-level military talks held recently between north and south korea after the 10th of this month.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the fifth round of general-level talks between north and south korea was held at the tongilgak on the north korean side of panmunjom between may 8-11.</seg>

<seg id="4"> according to the rules of the international boxing federation, the length of boxing ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long in international matches. however, based on the measurement of pedro roque, coach of the cuban boxing team, the boxing ring ropes at the pan american games were more than 1 meter shorter than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="5"> roque said, "we filed a formal protest because this does not just affect the country of cuba but involves all the people.</seg>
<seg id="6"> if the ropes are too short, it will affect the sidestep movements of boxers."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> a while ago, someone asked: are there any thirty-year-old mao supporters?</seg>
<seg id="3"> later, it was changed to twenty-year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="4"> actually people of this age group didn't experience the mao zedong era at all.  i don't know if the person who asked this question has had their brains washed away or if they were born dumb.</seg>
<seg id="5"> in the cities, those with the most right to talk about the mao zedong era should be those who experienced those years for themselves.  it's the people who suffered the torments of +those years.  that is to say, it should be people who were born between 1950 and 1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> after they were born, their parents were taking part in campaigns and didn't give their children the appropriate love.</seg>
<seg id="7"> just when they needed nutrition, they landed in three years of natural disaster and suffered the hardships of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="8"> when they started school, again they met with the cultural revolution, and several years of their education were wasted.</seg>
<seg id="9"> some of them even terminated their education forever.  when they were 15-17 years old, and had not finished their education, they were forced to abandon their studies and respond to the call of the party to go into remote areas and villages and to reinforce the border areas.</seg>
<seg id="10"> after they started work, they thought that the laboring class was the most honorable, so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and hardest work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> their honor was short-lived; their mediocrity stuck with them for a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="12"> when they were old enough to get married, getting married late, having children late and having only one child started with them.</seg>
<seg id="13"> +when they should have been getting +raises, the companies valued diplomas.  because they didn't have diplomas, the +raises didn't come.</seg>
<seg id="14"> they worked hard to bring up their children and give their children a full basic education.  when their children got into universities, they met with the double whammy of reform in the education system and reform of the state-owned enterprises.  tuition fees went up, and they were laid off.</seg>
<seg id="15"> as their age increased day by day, they started to get ill, and again they were unlucky in meeting with the reform of the healthcare system.  this meant that their diseased bodies couldn't get treatment because they couldn't pay the medical bills.</seg>
<seg id="16"> we can see that all of the unfairness in society fell mercilessly on the people of their generation.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but among these people there aren't many who are against mao zedong or who attack mao zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> they're not mao zedong's slaves.  they're flesh and blood, living right here among the people and groups of our society.  the history of their personal experiences, from going to the remote areas and villages to being laid off from their jobs, encapsulates the social phenomena of two eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> even though they are very unhappy about or even hate their wasted education, not having enough to eat, not having warm clothes, and some bad social phenomena during the mao zedong era, they still think the mao zedong era was good in terms of the national spirit, morality in personal relationships, and social practices</seg>

<seg id="1"> "injected watermelons," "cancer bananas," and "cardboard buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> posted by [wasteland beyond the great wall] at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send a message] [full view] i remember there was news two years ago of watermelons in hainan being injected with chemical drugs by someone using a syringe.  the result was that a load of hainan watermelons rotted in the field, and a lot of watermelon farmers got no return on their expenses.</seg>
<seg id="3"> cctv later did a follow-up report, and it turned out that they proved there had never been any such thing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> this report was weird from the beginning, because if you wanted to inject large watermelons with a syringe one by one, it would not only have no real point, it would also be impossible because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> my memory from last year is clearer.  there were reports in the media saying that banana trees in hainan were suffering from a disease similar to human cancer, and that the diseased banana trees were very likely to die.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the result was that it was misunderstood by lots of people to be that if you ate bananas you'd get cancer.  the result was the same again.  the price of hainan bananas dropped steeply, making the banana farmers cry till they had no more tears left and complain on and on.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the reason why the two reports above both caused such a stir was because they directly touched on people's most sensitive nerve, i.e. the issue of food safety.</seg>
<seg id="8"> if the media says such-and-such a food may threaten our health, then it will definitely get relayed ten times, and those ten times relayed a hundred times.  towards the subject involved, people generally prefer to take an attitude of better to believe it than not.  for a single person, eating a few less hainan watermelons, bananas, etc., is no big deal, after all.  but for the producers and sellers of those products, the impact gets very big.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, another storm burst in beijing over food safety.  it was that people had gone so far as to use processed cardboard boxes as the filling when making buns because the price of pork had gone up.  these were "cardboard buns."</seg>
<seg id="10"> when i heard this i was also deeply shocked.  i thought these stallholders have an amazing ability to find new tricks, if they've managed to think up this kind of method to cheat people.  moreover, i then passed on this piece of news to many people and warned my family and friends not to buy any more buns when they go out on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but yesterday there was suddenly another piece of news saying that the cardboard buns report was fake news, and the whole thing was made up by one person.  now at the same time as i'm feeling relieved i'm also very puzzled.  what on earth is with the media these days?</seg>
<seg id="12"> the facts of the matter that i've found out from reliable sources are: a temporary employee of the program "transparency" on the beijing tv lifestyle channel, zi something, took some pork filling himself that he'd bought from the market, flour and cardboard, and instructed wei someone and other people to soak the cardboard in water, mix it into the pork filling, and make it into buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> zi something used a domestic digital video camera that he'd taken to record the manufacturing process, then edited it and used tricks to get it broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14"> now the police have already detained the criminal suspect zi someone in accordance with the law, and will deal with him severely in accordance with the law.</seg>
<seg id="15"> since the bun incident occurred, the government has quickly organized the relevant departments to launch an investigation, and is conducting a thorough, comprehensive probe into beijing's breakfast market to guarantee safety on the public's dining tables.</seg>
<seg id="16"> since the truth of the incident was confirmed, beijing tv has made a public apology to the public and has learned an important lesson.  it has investigated and dealt with the relevant responsible people severely, and will further strengthen management, stop up leak points, and resolutely put an end to false and untrue news reports.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but even though the cardboard buns were pure fabrications, when everyone will dare to go again with confidence to the stalls to buy buns is as yet an unknown.</seg>
<seg id="18"> this incident also reflects from one perspective the importance that the government places on food safety and the speed of its action.  and to an extent it also shows that the dining tables of the beijing public are still fairly safe.  the false alarm of the bun incident has also been a reminder for everyone!</seg>

<seg id="1"> to whom do we owe a duty in education?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> recently i've heard friends back home talking about some news from a school, and i have to have my say about this.</seg>
<seg id="3"> it all happened at a private middle school in shanghai - south west weiyu middle school.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the school decided to arrange the best teachers for three classes of students from the school's own junior middle school who had signed contracts on direct admission to the senior middle school.  and it got some young teachers with unimpressive teaching records and no experience of teaching high school seniors to teach some other classes which had been admitted from other schools after examination or had not signed contracts for admission to this school.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the reason was: the students who signed contracts agreed at that time not to take the examinations for other senior middle schools, so the school must guarantee the best teachers for them according to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="6"> and the school's attitude to the students in other classes was: you should give young teachers the opportunity to gain experience.</seg>
<seg id="7"> this couldn't but make me wonder, to whom do we really owe a duty in education?</seg>
<seg id="8"> i remember when i studied at a key senior middle school many years ago, all of the students in my class were unhappy with the quality of one math teacher's teaching.  despite the complexity of things, we collectively signed a request that the school change our teacher.</seg>
<seg id="9"> in the end, the school really did give us another teacher, because the school's promise to us was that it would treat every student equally, that it would do its duty by every student.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ten years ago i came to the us to study for a postgraduate degree.</seg>
<seg id="11"> one summer, when i was choosing my courses for the next semester, i found that all the elective courses the department had arranged were all heavily theoretical courses, and they hadn't arranged any of some more practical courses.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i went to talk to the head of the department and told him i thought there was a problem with the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the head of the department admitted that the reason the curriculum did not include any practical courses was because of a lack of teachers.  in one or two years when they had teachers, they would be able to offer them.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i remember i said to him then: "this is your problem, not mine.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the reason i came halfway round the world from shanghai to study at this school was because i was attracted by the introduction of your curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="16"> if you can't offer these courses, then don't put them in the introduction, otherwise it's false advertising.  it's failing to do your duty by me and my family."</seg>
<seg id="17"> after listening to what i said, the department head thought for a while and then said, well, i'll see what we can do to solve this.</seg>
<seg id="18"> it may be already too late, because all of the courses have already been arranged and registered online.</seg>
<seg id="19"> three weeks later, the head of department came to talk to me, basically to tell me that his work was to take care of every student, including me.</seg>
<seg id="20"> he had listened to my advice and made his best efforts.  he had added two practical electives, and hoped i could understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> after this happened, i took a few courses taught by the head of department.</seg>
<seg id="22"> he never showed any bias against me because i'd complained to him.  in every class he very fairly gave me an a.</seg>
<seg id="23"> the night before graduation, i heard his secretary say that he did everything he could for every student, but not all the students were grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="24"> during the graduation ceremony, when i was making a speech on behalf of the honors students, i told the head of department: all of us in our hearts appreciated everything he'd done for us, because he had done all he could to do his duty by everyone of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i felt that i had made the right choice in life by coming to this school.</seg>
<seg id="26"> as i said this, i saw a glint of tears in the department head's eyes...if one day every education worker in china and the whole education system can do their duty by every single student, then i think china's golden age won't be far away.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> last sunday i took part in the central ny men's 4s volleyball tournament.  i played for six and a half hours, and in the end our team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this tournament was actually a warm-up tournament organized as preparation for taking part in the volleyball tournament at the summer sports games in new york(empire state games).</seg>
<seg id="4"> the coach split up central ny's four participating men's teams (the high-school team, the college team, the over-35s team and the over-45s team) and rearranged them into four-person teams, with a setter in each team, and started the matches.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the tournament rules were a lot of fun.  you could only do back row attacks, you couldn't dink the ball inside the three-meter line, only one setter was allowed to block, and there were no substitutions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> so basically it was a test of spiking power and judgment and blocking in defense.</seg>
<seg id="7"> our team had a 2m opposite hitter, who was both our strongest man and our tallest man in attack.  he took care of 60% of our attacks and points in the tournament.  one 1.85m setter solo blocked at the net and roofed a lot of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8"> a 1.90m middle hitter made quite a few mistakes in attack because he was in the back row.</seg>
<seg id="9"> and then there was me, a 1.75m spiker, making the occasional sneak attack, with a quite acceptable success rate.  i mainly received the other team's cross-court spikes.</seg>
<seg id="10"> there were seven teams in total.  first was a round robin.  after my team won one match, the referee kept judging that our opposite hitter had fouled by stepping on the line while spiking.  this had a big impact on our morale, and in no time we'd lost three matches in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but after we'd lost, everyone calmed down, and our teamwork also came together during these three matches, so we started a winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="12"> after the round robin, my team had won three, lost three.  because of our low scores, we were in 6th position.</seg>
<seg id="13"> then we started the playoffs.  apart from the team in first place, all the teams placed 2 through 7 played against one another in the elimination round.</seg>
<seg id="14"> our team was psychologically and tactically settled, so we played hard and took no prisoners.  we led all the way and got into the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> our opponents in the semi-finals were good in attack but weak in defense.  my arms got beaten black and blue, but when i did manage to save a hard spike, the level of satisfaction was twice that i got by scoring from spiking the ball myself.</seg>
<seg id="16"> i didn't even know what the final score was when we won.</seg>
<seg id="17"> the opponents in the final had balanced attack and defense.  our serves broke a lot of their attacks, and we led from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> finally we had match point at 21-24, and our opponents made two serves in a row that i couldn't control.  at 23-24 our opposite hitter came over and said to me, it doesn't matter, it's only two shots.</seg>
<seg id="19"> the next shot came flying at me again, but it was okay, i passed it quite well, the setter back-passed it to the opposite hitter, and a hard spike finished the competition.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> i've already said a lot about morality for isolated free individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3"> on this subject i haven't got anything worth repeating.</seg>
<seg id="4"> what i want to say now concerns groups.</seg>
<seg id="5"> we often meet situations that require groups.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in these situations, there is a need for groups to have some morality.</seg>
<seg id="7"> we can often find some very good morals in groups that have achieved success.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="9"> because for these causes or activities, we need to overcome some of the difficulties before us, to pull together, rid ourselves of those elements based on faith.  i think it's those good morals that also play a role that can't be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="10"> at the very least, a group of people with very low moral standards will find it very difficult to complete any successful major project together.  this can be predicted with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id="11"> perhaps it is because the wisdom that enables one to see the long term interests with reasoned and forward vision is a necessary quality for success in a group.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in reality, groups often use all kinds of methods to obtain an identity, for example, logos, jargon, beliefs, etc. etc., and also morality.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [discussion] how many times in your life have you been truly happy?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> a good friend of mine from senior middle school has finally got her visa and will set out at the end of august for a top school on the west coast of the usa to study for a postgraduate degree.</seg>
<seg id="3"> today a few people from my school got together, and we were truly glad for her.  at last she'd got what she wanted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> seeing her so happy, i was really envious.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i thought, i'm all grown up, but i've only been that happy the time i passed my exams to get into senior middle school.  at the time i'd never thought i'd be able to get into the well-known school ranked first or second in the entire city.  later, i went predictably on to go to college and get a job.  in all that time i was never so happy again.</seg>
<seg id="6"> when i passed the exams to get into college, it wasn't the one i'd aimed for before, so you couldn't say i was particularly happy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> during my time at college, the only thing that kept me going was that after graduating i could go up north and get together with a guy who i'd been in love with for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> but fate always intervenes, and a month before i graduated, he broke up with me.  all of my fantasies from before collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="9"> later i just went back to the north to work.  now i've been working for nearly two years, and i've made enough money for a mid-range car, but i haven't ever felt that happy again.</seg>
<seg id="10"> chatting with my good friend today, i was really able to feel her happiness.  having slaved in preparation for a year, beside herself with worry, she has finally succeeded in getting abroad, and is going to start a new life.  that feeling of a dream coming true really makes one very happy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i haven't planned to carry on studying, and i don't like living overseas either, because i worked overseas for half a year before, and found that life abroad doesn't actually suit me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> having seen how happy my friend was, i couldn't help thinking, what are my goals?</seg>
<seg id="13"> what can make me that happy again?</seg>
<seg id="14"> perhaps it's finding someone who really loves me, and is willing to stay with me for the rest of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i think at that time i'll be excited enough to cry, just as my good friend said to me, when she passed the embassy interview and got her clearance certificate, she couldn't stop herself crying.  a year of hard work and worry had finally been rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="16"> and me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> in relationships, i've given the most meticulous care, putting my heart into it over and over.  when will i also get what i want, and cry for happiness?</seg>
<seg id="18"> perhaps i'm just a loser.  i've never worried about my career, but what about my love life?</seg>
<seg id="19"> when will my love life sort itself out?</seg>
<seg id="20"> i've always felt down on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="21"> what about you, all you boys and girls?</seg>
<seg id="22"> how many times in your lives have you been truly happy?</seg>

<seg id="1"> a big advertisement for the school of architecture, south east university</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> haha, and this also counts as letting seu alumni know what's going on at the school of architecture.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the latest first-hand news, plus my own comments -- refund guaranteed if it's fake.</seg>
<seg id="4"> dean wang, secretary an, professor li of the personnel office, as well as several other lecturers from the architectural technology and science teaching and research office, attended the presentation.  i talked for an hour, and then everyone discussed it for about an hour and a half.</seg>
<seg id="5"> after the official presentation finished, professor zhang (assistant to the dean of the school) pulled me aside and said to me, let's go into the back office, shut the door and have a talk.</seg>
<seg id="6"> he was extremely friendly.  he closed the door and told me that at formal meetings there are some things that it's better not to say.  he said that it was clear that i had no basic idea about my future income, and then told me some specifics about the incomes of lecturers at the school of architecture to stop me worrying.</seg>
<seg id="7"> dean wang had given an overview of the school of architecture before the presentation.  he said that there were six key architecture-related programs in total across the country.  there are two at seu, two at tsinghua, one at tongji, and one at tianjin univ.  there are none apart from these.</seg>
<seg id="8"> he said that in the past few years the state has laid a special emphasis on conserving energy resources in building, "green" architecture, and architectural science and technology, and that seu wanted to bring in a lecturer in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9"> he said they'd received over 20 resumes that came in one after another, applying for this position.  there were locals, there were japanese, there were americans (apparently just one: me).</seg>
<seg id="10"> the school of architecture saw this as very important, and examined the applicants very carefully.</seg>
<seg id="11"> compared with some of the other architecture schools in colleges that i know, seu really is pretty cutting edge.  tongji's urban planning is probably a shade better than seu, but it seems that seu may still be a little ahead in terms of architectural design (this is something i hadn't realized before.)</seg>
<seg id="12"> dean wang said that in the last two years the school of architecture's funding had been more than adequate.  it was one of the key schools being developed in the national 985 project.</seg>
<seg id="13"> he told me that last year, the government gave lump-sum funding of 10 million in development expenses to the seu soa.  of this, 3.5 million was spent directly on buying books to enrich the school of architecture's specialist library (haha, even i want to give a big thumbs up to this: a generous deed!</seg>
<seg id="14"> ).  the rest of it was almost all used buying equipment for experiments in my field.</seg>
<seg id="15"> it's said that this aroused complaints from several academicians.</seg>
<seg id="16"> haha - by the way, i think they seem to have been ripped off on some imported equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17"> there's one test system for measuring how airtight a room is.  in america it's very common.  i reckon you could definitely get it for 500 us dollars.  but it turns out that seu spent 50,000 renminbi on it!!!</seg>
<seg id="18"> there's some other things, too.  a lot of colleges and departments at seu have now moved to the new campus at jiulong lake, but the school of architecture insists on staying.  it says it wants to give the students a good architectural environment.  the old campus still has some classic architecture for them to see, whereas the new campus doesn't have anything.</seg>
<seg id="19"> haha - it seems like the school of architecture has also requested and obtained another building because the other departments have all moved out.</seg>
<seg id="20"> so dean wang said straight out to me that in future he would be able to give me my own office.</seg>
<seg id="21"> i'm extremely embarrassed: when dean wang said this, i didn't have even the slightest reaction.</seg>
<seg id="22"> later, professor zhang pulled me aside and told me that this was not easy to get, because offices were in extremely short supply.  some of the senior professors didn't even have their own offices.</seg>
<seg id="23"> this made me feel very unsettled.  it seems i still don't, ah, understand the situation in this country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> overall, i've had a very pleasant trip to seu.  the senior faculty and connected lecturers at the seu school of architecture have shown themselves to be extremely professional and hospitable, and have made a very good impression on me.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i hope everything goes well for seu in its development, and may the school of architecture continue to maintain its leading position!</seg>

<seg id="3"> showing off "mouse muscles."</seg>
<seg id="4"> with world vision, for the second time stephanie sun has gone on in africa from congo to niger.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at a press conference yesterday, she admitted frankly that it was the most tiring journey she had ever made.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the weather in that area is scorching, the drinking water dirty, and when she visited a market she encountered people at a protest angrily throwing stones.  even riding on a camel she was scratched by the saddle.</seg>
<seg id="7"> throughout the journey there was mishap after mishap, making her scream to herself several times, "i really want to go home!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> shock at seeing the children's malnutrition</seg>
<seg id="9"> having taken part in world vision's campaigns to care for poor children for the past three consecutive years, stephanie sun calls herself an experienced spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="10"> she took 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 flashlights, and 500 sweets to share with the local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> she said that having accumulated a lot of experience, she knew that no matter how many little gifts she took, they would never be enough.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in niger, the most serious problem is that mothers have no understanding of the issues involved in child raising, so the children suffer from serious malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="13"> on the eight-hour car journey from the capital of niger to the small town of dara 500 kilometers away, stephanie sun experienced a sandstorm rarely seen in the area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the wind blew sand and brought rain, and the whole sky changed colors with the wind and clouds.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the jeep they were riding in shook more and more in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="16"> recalling that moment, stephanie sun shuddered at the memory, revealing that even though she was in the car, she was very afraid.</seg>
<seg id="17"> she only relaxed a little when she later heard local people explaining that the sandstorm was a sign of good luck, bringing rain and moisture to the soil.</seg>
<seg id="18"> with local residents.</seg>
<seg id="19"> pained by mothers' problems raising children</seg>
<seg id="20"> when she arrived at dara, local officials held a dromedary welcome ceremony and invited stephanie sun to sit on the camel and be cheered by the local people.</seg>
<seg id="21"> but the camel was scared by the flashes and got completely out of control, nearly throwing stephanie sun to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="22"> finally stephanie sun jumped down herself, but her clothes were accidentally got ripped by a hook on the saddle which scratched her arm, leaving a small bloody streak about eight centimeters long.</seg>
<seg id="23"> on this trip, stephanie sun visited four sick local children with severe malnourishment.  one of them was a baby four months old, weighing just 2.1 kilograms.  it didn't look like a person at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> she said: "when i saw him, my heart ached.  his condition was really so extreme.  but it must also be the mother's problem.  we should teach them correct ideas about nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="3"> the goal of education is: to make the educated more able to live in and enjoy the existing social environment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "live" everyone can easily understand, but perhaps everyone has just understood "enjoy" as simply "have fun."  actually, that's not right.  the scope of "enjoy" here is very broad.</seg>
<seg id="5"> live: this includes the strengthening of the body and the strengthening of the mind.</seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. strengthening of the body: through various forms of physical %pw, increase +physical strength, improve coordination, bring about steady improvement in sporting ability, so that you can meet the need for sufficient physical exercise and the needs of engaging with society.</seg>
<seg id="7"> 2. strengthening of the mind: to be able to recognize more clearly the society in which you find yourself, to know yourself, to learn to engage with other people, to learn the ability to adapt yourself as you live and to experience and enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="8"> above i've explained the goals of education, but the connection with this essay isn't very strong.  now i'll talk about the key point: the key to chinese education - humanize it</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> club original writing: a few common stages in learning about buffett: i'm strolling</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) stage one: introduction to buffett.  you have a feeling of finally finding what you've been looking for, and immediately apply it in real life, but at this time your understanding of buffett's ideas is not deep, not thorough.  very often you'll make a lot of mistakes in using them, apply them incorrectly, and apply them blindly, so the results will be patchy.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) stage two: "surpassing" buffett.  after a period of learning and practice, almost every "intelligent person" is thinking about a few questions: for example, what should a buffett with chinese characteristics be like?</seg>
<seg id="5"> does buffett's theory need to be applied flexibly in china?</seg>
<seg id="6"> can i do even better than buffett?</seg>
<seg id="7"> so the main features of this stage are overconfidence and blind arrogance, looking for a buffett theory with chinese characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="8"> after a period of application, the results will generally still be patchy and inconsistent.  if your luck is good, it's better to have some losses and quickly return to the mainstream.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) stage three: you return to buffett.  after a few wrong turns, you are finally able to realize that +you are an ordinary person, not a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> you should demand a little less of yourself.  making a solid study of buffett is more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the simplest turns out to be the most effective.  but the simple methods often include very deep thinking, and you must understand this thinking before you can better apply the simple through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the characteristics of this stage are results that are not substantial in the short term, but plentiful in the long term, and consistent.</seg>
<seg id="13"> stage four: "inflexible" buffett.  having achieved consistent results, in this stage you are basically inflexible with regard to buffett's theories.  you take no notice at all of companies other than buffett's.</seg>
<seg id="14"> you go on learning and deepening your understanding of buffett and applying it in real life.  the characteristics of this stage are ever-improving results, consistency, and entering into a virtuous spiral.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the time that each person need for each stage varies.  it depends on both your personal situation and your luck.</seg>

<seg id="7"> on a highway in the mountain three bandits with guns spotted a pretty woman driver.  they forced the mid-sized bus to stop and tried to take the woman driver off the bus for some fun.  the woman driver desperately cried for help, but all the passengers on the bus were too scared to move.</seg>
<seg id="8"> just one scrawny middle-aged man responded and went to fight with them, but he was knocked to the ground and suffered injuries.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the man got really angry, vigorously shouting to everyone on the bus to stop the assault, but nobody responded, allowing the woman driver to be dragged into the bushes in the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="10"> half an hour later, the three bandits returned with the woman driver, whose clothes were disheveled.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the bus was going to start again.  the woman driver told the scrawny man, who had been hurt and was bleeding, to get off the bus.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the man refused, and became argumentative.</seg>
<seg id="13"> hey, get off the bus!  my bus won't take you.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the middle-aged man became desperate and said: why are you being so unreasonable?  was i wrong to try to save you?</seg>
<seg id="15"> you save me?</seg>
<seg id="16"> what did you save me from?</seg>
<seg id="17"> the woman driver flatly dismissed him, and a few passengers sniggered.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the middle-aged man got really angry, and cursed himself for not having the strength of a superhero.</seg>
<seg id="19"> but even if he hadn't succeeded in saving anyone, he didn't deserve to be turned out of the bus like this as a result.  he firmly refused to get off.</seg>
<seg id="20"> for another thing, i've bought a ticket.  i have a right to stay on the bus!</seg>
<seg id="21"> the driver turned away from him and said coldly: if you don't get off the bus, i'm not driving.</seg>
<seg id="22"> unexpectedly, all of the passengers on the bus who had just ignored the assault seemed to have just woken up and jointly told the man to get off the bus: quickly, get off the bus.  we've got things to do, we can't wait.</seg>
<seg id="23"> a few strong passengers even wanted to come forward and drag the middle-aged man off the bus.  it was enough to make you think of the story from "boule de suif" by maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> the three bandits were grinning, laughing with satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="25"> one of them, a dark-skinned thug with no principles, said shamelessly: us guys did everything we wanted with her!</seg>
<seg id="26"> the two other bandits also started talking trash: she's my girlfriend, it's got damn-all to do with you!</seg>
<seg id="27"> there was uproar, until the man's luggage was thrown out of the window of the bus, and then he was shoved out.</seg>
<seg id="28"> the bus once again drove steadily along the mountain road.  the woman driver arranged her hair, and turned on the recorder.</seg>
<seg id="29"> the bus had nearly reached the top of a hill.  when it had gone around this turn it would start going down.  to the left of the bus was the road blasted out of the hillside.  on the right was a cliff hundreds of feet high.</seg>
<seg id="30"> the bus quietly picked up speed.  the woman driver's face was completely composed, her two hands holding the steering wheel tightly, tears glittering in her eyes.</seg>
<seg id="31"> one of the bandits seemed to sense something and said: slow down, slow down, what the fuck are you trying to do?</seg>
<seg id="32"> the woman driver didn't say anything, and the bus went faster and faster.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the bandit tried to run forward and grab the steering wheel, but the bus sped towards the cliff like an arrow from a bow...</seg>
<seg id="34"> the next day the local newspapers reported: a tragedy occurred yesterday in fuhu mountain area.  a mid-sized bus fell off a cliff.</seg>
<seg id="35"> there were no survivors among the driver and 13 passengers.</seg>

<seg id="1"> darkness at the railroad station</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> recently i was away from home for a few days.  i took the train, and discovered the nastiness of railway stations everywhere during the summer high season.</seg>
<seg id="3"> i wanted to understand more about what we should be aware of at railroad stations in various places.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i'm from changsha, so i'll first say a bit about the situation in changsha.  everyone should be aware of this when they come to changsha!</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. train tickets are always difficult to buy.  at changsha railroad station, at every major holiday or the beginning and end of the summer and winter school vacation, you have absolutely no chance of getting a ticket.  however early you go, queuing up is useless.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the best answer i've received when i asked is that the travel agencies book up all the tickets.</seg>
<seg id="7"> but with the ticket touts, you can pay a bit extra and have as many as you want.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. watch out for fake tickets.  the tickets that the touts have are not necessarily real.  shuangfeng and xinhua in hunan make their money, one from fake certificates and one from fake coins, so fake tickets is really just child's play!</seg>
<seg id="9"> amending tickets is the most basic.  some tickets look so real that even the train attendants can't tell the difference.</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. who touched my money?  when buying things at stores at railroad stations, you absolutely must be careful!</seg>
<seg id="11"> if you want to give them small bills, haha, your bills are always missing a corner, so you have to use a large bill instead.</seg>
<seg id="12"> but when you give a large bill instead, once the store owner has got his hands on it, he will definitely say he can't change it, give it back to you and ask for those small bills with the missing corners again.  at this point all you can do is take back a fake large bill!</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. change from a magician.  not every store owner will swap your big bills.  that's a crime, and the risks are pretty big!</seg>
<seg id="14"> so some "cowardly" store owners have to be magicians.  you clearly see that your change is right when they count it, but when you have a chance to count it yourself, haha!  it's short by a few bills.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. imported drinks everywhere.  there aren't that many cafes at the railroad station, but if you go in one you'll understand.</seg>
<seg id="16"> a few glasses of rough red wine are sold at the price of martell.  if you don't pay... then even your mother might not recognize you.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. roses and guns.  there are a lot of video booths around the railroad station.  the titles of the films showing are very attractive to us common men, so if you go in and watch, you'll be surely taken to be a distinguished guest who wants a little relaxation.  so a flower girl will come along straight away to keep you company.  of course, you need to have enough money for a five-star hotel consumption, otherwise those big knives aren't always used for fighting foreign devils!</seg>

<seg id="19"> but if this is your first time in changsha, then congratulations!  never mind that you are going somewhere five minutes' walk away, the driver will still be glad to take you to enjoy the sights of this national-level key tourism city, and will also let you breathe a lungful of secondhand smoke from the famous white sand brand and have a smell that it is loaded with the local specialty - betel flavoring.</seg>
<seg id="20"> of course, you have to pay for the transport yourself, don't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> nanjing metro drivers should get psychotherapy asap</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key word: psychotherapy</seg>
<seg id="3"> according to a report from xinhua news agency, there was a suicide on the tracks in the nanjing metro on the evening of july 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> according to what the reporter says, "zhu zhengting, 22, is a young metro driver.  he had a nightmarish experience.  when this reporter saw him yesterday, he seemed not to have recovered from his horror.  he was sitting very straight up in his chair, and his eyes also looked a little glazed."</seg>
<seg id="5"> obviously, this young driver's nerves had received a big shock, and he urgently needed to get some psychotherapy, otherwise it would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i don't know if everyone remembers the emergency rescue guy who saved a little girl in an abandoned oil well in the us +state of texas over a decade ago.  after suffering long-term psychological torture, he eventually chose to kill himself and ended his painful life.</seg>
<seg id="7"> even though he had had basic psychotherapy at the time, people focused more on the little girl who had been rescued and overlooked precisely the one person who needed psychotherapy more.  in the end, they failed to prevent this tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the same way, in the dover straits illegal immigration case a few years ago, it was said that the first british policeman to open the container went into shock right there.</seg>
<seg id="9"> afterwards the british authorities gave him over two months of psychotherapy before he got back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="10"> when people suffer a catastrophic shock, their minds are wounded very seriously.  at this time, if you rely only on your own resources it's very difficult to make a full recovery, and often psychological scars will be left.</seg>
<seg id="11"> since these scars are very difficult for others to find, and if they do find them, there's nothing they can do, many people involved in incidents will be in pain for the rest of their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, in our country people don't care enough about psychological wounds, particularly the families or employers of the people involved often think of it only after they've missed the best window for recovery.  then it's already too late.</seg>
<seg id="13"> now that there is more diversity in the broadcast media, we often hear about shocking things.  a lot of young women get hurt, and a lot of young children see their own parents suffer terrible injuries.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after these young people have been rescued, we very rarely hear that they have received psychological treatment.  more often they are consoled by the love of their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> although the victims can feel that they are now safe, the past harm becomes a scar that can never be removed and can be inflamed at any time.  this affects the life of the person involved.</seg>
<seg id="16"> we can be grateful that this driver's superiors quickly calmed him down, and were able to ease his psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="17"> ultimately, the driver was not to blame for the accident, and the driver took measures when he discovered the situation.  he had done what he should have done, but just hadn't stopped the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i'm sure anyone there would have been shocked by the accident that happened on the scene, even if they weren't the driver involved.</seg>
<seg id="19"> but other people didn't have any connection with the suicide.  even if they were shocked, they would gradually forget as time went by.</seg>
<seg id="20"> but the driver involved isn't that lucky.  he has to remember, and very likely will remember it all his life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> if he can free himself from this, then he's lucky.  if he can't free himself from it, then he'll often be tortured by this kind of shock.</seg>
<seg id="22"> the modern conception of health is much more comprehensive than in the past.  psychological health is starting to be noticed by people.</seg>
<seg id="23"> the pity is that the psychological condition of humanity is very depressing.  particularly in the cities, people's psychological health is not at all what it should be.  many people have psychological problems to a greater or lesser extent, and some people are not able to get enough attention when they encounter problems.</seg>
<seg id="24"> think of the lessons of the yang lijuan incident a while back.  some irresponsible news outlets turned a sick person tormented by psychological problems into the subject of media hype, causing very bad impact on our society.</seg>
<seg id="25"> in the future we should avoid this kind of thing happening, otherwise our society really will turn into a sick society.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: dongkou no. 5 middle school, teacher's first period, new syllabus %pw   five teachers from dongkou no. 5 middle school feel overwhelmed after the first period of training in the new syllabus  from the morning of july 13 to the 15th, the first group of teachers from dongkou no. 5 middle school to take the training for the new syllabus got a real taste of the pressure and the motivation from the new syllabus.</seg>
<seg id="3"> at the same time, they also feel that the syllabus reform is a rare opportunity and challenge for the development of teaching at the school.</seg>
<seg id="4"> on the morning of the 13th, because roadwork on the stretch of road from shijiang in dongkou to longhui had caused a traffic jam, it was already past 1:00 p.m. by the time the teachers from dongkou no. 5 middle school and teachers from suining and other places made it to the municipal education bureau.  the staff at the education bureau, who had long worked beyond their midday break, %pw still got the training materials that they had loaded into cars out of the cars again and did the necessary paperwork for us, and we got our training materials.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at 2.30 p.m., the travel-weary teachers again braved the scorching heat and separately entered the multimedia classrooms at municipal no. 1 middle school, municipal no. 2 middle school and municipal no. 6 middle school to listen to lectures by the relevant experts.</seg>
<seg id="6"> over the next two days, the teachers listened to lectures by the editors of the teaching materials or listened to lessons learned from the experiences of teachers in provinces which had already started the new syllabus reform.  some of the educational researchers or teachers who had attended province-level training in the new syllabus also talked about their experiences and what they had learned.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on the morning of the 15th, after finishing all of the training courses, we then went through assessment.  the five teachers from dongkou no. 5 middle school had studied hard and never came in late or left earlier, so they passed the assessment easily, and all received a certificate of course completion.</seg>
<seg id="8"> during the training period, the dongkou no. 5 middle school teachers talked among themselves.  at first we all felt that the new syllabus was rather unfamiliar, that this was a difficult task, that there was a lot of pressure, and that it was difficult to understand.</seg>
<seg id="9"> but after the training was finished, everyone thought that this was also an opportunity and a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> we are all determined to work at adjusting the structure of our knowledge and complete the task of syllabus reform as satisfactorily as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the second group of teachers to attend the new syllabus training arrived at the relevant location for training on the 16th.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: fans of celebrities</seg>
<seg id="3"> i have a female friend whom i've never seen.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i said straight out to her, i really admire you!</seg>
<seg id="5"> because you express your love candidly.</seg>
<seg id="6"> she likes a male host of a popular entertainment program in taiwan, and has never hidden her feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7"> when this male host hosts a program in jinan, she flies to jinan; when this male host goes to changsha to do a guest appearance, she flies to changsha.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the male host says in his book that a friend gave him a slingshot with no shot.  pleasantly surprised, she told me, "i gave him that slingshot."</seg>
<seg id="9"> she also helps to do an online magazine about this star.  every issue she excitedly reads it with me.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i've always really liked talking with some people who frankly admit that they are a fan of such-and-such a celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="11"> these celebrities can be movie stars, can be sports stars, and of course can also be great figures.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i've never thought that these friends are shallow.  i think they're very lovely.</seg>
<seg id="13"> these people are usually straightforward people.  if they like someone, they like someone, if they don't like someone, they don't like them.</seg>
<seg id="14"> getting along with this kind of people can be very easy.</seg>
<seg id="15"> although they won't think 100% about your feelings, you at least know what makes them tick.  you also know that you will feel more secure if you spend time with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> these people are also very honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> you should know that it also takes courage to dare to express your likings.</seg>
<seg id="18"> it's precisely because of this that a lot of people just secretly like a person their entire life, or they might even look down a little on those people who barefacedly say they are a fan of so-and-so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i think honesty is a person's greatest strong point, being honest with friends and being honest with yourself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> but it is actually very hard to do that.</seg>
<seg id="21"> if one can love a celebrity, it also proves that a part of his heart is selfless.</seg>
<seg id="22"> some of my friends are fans of celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="23"> sometimes they can go through a lot of hardship to get a look at this celebrity.  they can sacrifice many things, tighten their belts and scrimp and save, holding a placard in their left hand and pressing a camera button with their right, while shouting on and on.</seg>
<seg id="24"> you could say they are very silly or childish, but it takes selflessness to love someone without looking for anything in return.</seg>
<seg id="25"> because in reality, there are far too many who love themselves, think they're great, and think little of other people.  so this bit of selflessness seems to be quite precious.</seg>
<seg id="26"> so when everyone starts chatting and saying that the celebrity they like is so-and-so, if someone says, i've never made anyone my idol...</seg>
<seg id="27"> haha, then you should watch out.</seg>

<seg id="1"> teresa cheung the person</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: teresa cheung</seg>
<seg id="3"> by chance i had an opportunity to see an episode of "kangxi come" that i hadn't seen for a long time.  the main guest was teresa cheung.</seg>
<seg id="4"> thinking back, it was when she was promoting "color blossoms."</seg>
<seg id="5"> the time when i saw "colour blossoms" was the days when i was mad about erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> at the time i thought it was extraordinary that sex movies could be filmed in such an esthetic way.  sometimes they were also really interesting and were called erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> actually, i haven't seen many erotic movies, but they cover quite a lot of countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the first ones i saw were from korea and japan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> later i also saw quite a lot from third world countries and some from latin america and europe.  but i didn't see many hollywood or french movies.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i couldn't bear to delete two of them from my computer.  one is "plum blossom," and the other is just "color blossoms."</seg>
<seg id="11"> the first half of "color blossoms" is quite good.  they are all first-timers and act very energetically.  the direction is also very measured.</seg>
<seg id="12"> then in the second half it's a bit perverted, i can't take it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> actually, what i want to say is that teresa cheung said on the program that her boyfriends have included those of almost every nationality in the world, except for africans.</seg>
<seg id="14"> at present, she has four boyfriends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> on this issue, i'm afraid the average person would find it unacceptable and would say this person is a slut.</seg>
<seg id="16"> but the key point in this issue is that she was very honest when she was talking about these issues.  there wasn't a hint of an expression that would make people uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="17"> she also talked about her view of love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> for example, both parties should keep their money separate.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i guess their identities should also be independent.  each one controls their own fate.</seg>
<seg id="20"> because i know that for people who are in love, love is alive, is selfish.  how could it allow the person you love to accept the love of another person at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="21"> going by my experience and guesswork, most likely teresa cheung's love is no longer a simple entanglement.  she must be going for the classic relationship with a younger man.</seg>
<seg id="22"> in a relationship with a younger man, the older woman can accommodate anything, including having several toyboys at the same time.  at the same time, the younger man can attach himself without reservation to the older woman because of her attractiveness and maternal nature, but maybe doesn't mind whether he is the only one, etc., etc.</seg>
<seg id="23"> but i also felt from what teresa cheung said that she is someone who really knows how to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="24"> for example, she is +crazily passionate about travel.</seg>
<seg id="25"> so i also have reason to believe that her life is also very exciting.</seg>
<seg id="26"> if it was the past me, i'm afraid i would still not be able to accept this kind of thing.</seg>
<seg id="27"> just like now, i've come to accept a lot of people.  actually, this hasn't got that much to do with tolerance or intolerance, it's just about thinking it over in your own mind, then there are no absolute loves or hates.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these people, like passer-by a, friend b, zhang ziyi, good friend c, and sister lotus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> looking at other people's lives, i am an onlooker, so to other people, mustn't i also be the main character in my own life?</seg>
<seg id="30"> it's just like, even though i'm not in jianghu, there are always stories about me in jianghu.</seg>

<seg id="1"> people always need a spice of entertainment</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: spice of entertainment</seg>
<seg id="3"> for people, life is a tiring thing, so it's best if we have a spice of entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> either laughing at ourselves or watching jokes from the people around us, gossiping about other people.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for example, just going to the tianya "celebrity gossip" board for a bit of relaxation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in there, everyone says whatever they want, but you should of course have a bit of ability to distinguish between right and wrong, because there's all kinds of "trickery."</seg>
<seg id="7"> the results of "say what you want" are that you don't even know what you're saying yourself, but you want to be clear what it is you're reading.</seg>
<seg id="8"> little s calls tsai kang-yung a "scholar."</seg>
<seg id="9"> if i also count as one, then it's the kind who has read some books, but hasn't yet really grasped them.</seg>
<seg id="10"> at least i always know my own shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but, the +good thing is that i got a few things that i myself wanted to get when i did this bit of reading.</seg>
<seg id="12"> it also happens that i like just pondering over things, too.  so i was pondering and reading at the same time, but i got quite a few ideas clear.  a lot of things clicked into place.</seg>
<seg id="13"> so, gradually i got into some habits, like telling myself to be a bit harder on myself and a bit better to other people.</seg>
<seg id="14"> when running into a problem with some matter, first look for the cause in yourself.</seg>
<seg id="15"> use your head in the way you do things and follow your heart in dealing with relationships.</seg>
<seg id="16"> keep a low profile and do things in a low key.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but, you know, not all people are that nice.  they'll always be selfish, and always think about their own gains and losses.  there'll always be times when they should be using their heads, but they follow their hearts into a big mess, and times when they should be following their hearts, but they're still using f**king logic like there's no tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="18"> but at least there is a good side: i never regret the choices i've made.</seg>
<seg id="19"> if i've done it then i've done it; if i've messed up, then i live with it.</seg>
<seg id="20"> what's the point in thinking about all that useless stuff?</seg>
<seg id="21"> at least i'm not one of those people who likes to be all po-faced and puff myself up as a scholar.  i'm just an ordinary person, too.</seg>
<seg id="22"> where i'm different from other people is just that i don't have to be cynical.  i'm a bit more reasonable in dealing with matters in general.</seg>
<seg id="23"> or, for example, my trust is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="24"> once i trust someone, then i'll think that everything about him is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> even if there are shortcomings, i'm still perfectly happy to forgive them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> even though i'm not the type of person to call people friends readily, i'm the kind who thinks about his friends and puts himself in their shoes.</seg>
<seg id="27"> but i'm also therefore pretty strict in choosing my friends.</seg>
<seg id="28"> i also don't understand at all why there are still so many people today who trust so much everything the newspapers say.</seg>
<seg id="29"> or is it that in their minds, today's reports are still sacred like those of the past?</seg>
<seg id="30"> but then, in this world, there are still a lot of things that i don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="31"> jokes.</seg>
<seg id="32"> giving myself a slap on the face.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: song dandan, the secrets of happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> a while ago, i read in the newspaper that song dandan had published a new book called "the secrets of happiness."</seg>
<seg id="4"> i really wanted to read it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> because i thought that as a woman of this age, with this kind of profession, she had experienced changes in her family and in her career.  having gone through these, what are her views on herself and on life?</seg>
<seg id="6"> as expected, i was not disappointed.  after i read it, i had two feelings.  first, i got an electric shock: looking at someone else's life, you can see the image of your own life just the same.  second, i was also very much moved.  it was full of things like the details of her love for her family.</seg>
<seg id="7"> why did i get an electric shock?</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the book, song dandan writes, "i missed an important principle in life: one is happier to give than to receive.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i was always busy giving, busy making myself happy.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i never received, and never understood how to.  i neglected to allow other people to give, which is to say, i neglected other people's right to make themselves happy."</seg>
<seg id="11"> i find that i've also been always enjoying this kind of happiness.  in the future perhaps i should be a bit more careful.</seg>
<seg id="12"> it requires a certain amount of courage for a person to look steadily on their own past, and lay it all out in front of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="13"> in here she includes her first love, her failed marriage with ying da and her deep dissection of herself and her love for her son.</seg>
<seg id="14"> this book has another praiseworthy aspect, because at first the publisher must have given her a lot of pressure to focus more on cases like "i love my family," "house of the flying daggers" and the series of sketches with zhao benshan.</seg>
<seg id="15"> but she probably stood her ground.  she only mentions zhao benshan a bit at the end, and as for "house of the flying daggers" and "i love my family," she hardly mentions them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> the whole book is full of the warm and moving reflections of a 40-year-old woman on life, on love, on family, and on love for the family.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: vacation, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> i've been on vacation for nearly a week, but i haven't had any time at all to relax.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i went to the college for a meeting, and i have to prepare the materials for going on a trip next week for a conference, and a speech for the conference.</seg>
<seg id="5"> this vacation will be very busy.</seg>
<seg id="6"> barring accidents, according to my schedule i have three conferences to attend and four or five cities to go to.</seg>
<seg id="7"> my life has suddenly been filled up with many things: the same things, different things.  i've almost forgotten how i used to spend the vacations before.</seg>
<seg id="8"> it seems that in my memory, i still didn't have much relaxation time.</seg>
<seg id="9"> it's just that before i still had long periods of time that i could arrange myself, but this year it seems like there's less time.</seg>
<seg id="10"> is this a good thing?  or a bad thing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> being busy, you feel a bit more substantial, but if there's no results or no gains for your busy work, then there is much less point to being busy.</seg>
<seg id="12"> but sometimes it seems that life can't be completely measured in terms of results.  life is to be gradually experienced.  solidity and stability, substance and pleasure are also a kind of gains, even though sometimes this gain can't be measured using society's appraisal standards.</seg>
<seg id="13"> every person needs confirmation from society's values and their own values.  if we can't get both, what do we do?</seg>
<seg id="14"> marxism teaches us that we should take the values of society as primary, and proposes that individuals should contribute to society.  but in reality, a healthy, wholesome society should also fully respect an individual's wishes and value choices, and should create the conditions in which personal values can be realized.</seg>
<seg id="15"> as all this occurred to my mind all of a sudden, i'm discovering more and more that marxist principles really are very effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> the truth really is like this, but when it actually comes to real life, people often find they are still bound to feel confused.</seg>
<seg id="17"> even if the realization of personal values doesn't interfere with society's values, will each one of us practical individuals be content with the realization of our own real values so much that we ignore the judgment of society?</seg>
<seg id="18"> or can the satisfaction with our own values be separated from the judgment of society?</seg>
<seg id="19"> i'd say it's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20"> so each of us is bound to pursue the extraordinary and beyond, even as we are working to be a good ordinary person.  and if we waste our lives, we also will always blame ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="21"> this could be said to be one side of socialized man.</seg>
<seg id="22"> being on vacation i still feel more or less a bit relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="23"> at least, i have time to watch some dvds, and i can relax myself and have fun for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24"> i can say what i want, but i still have to work, and life goes on just the same.</seg>
<seg id="25"> next week i have to go to xi'an again for a conference.</seg>
<seg id="26"> it's a city that i've never been to, but that i don't seem to much like, because of some "prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope that this trip can change my impression of the city, haha.</seg>

<seg id="4"> ying said: "no way!  you are too cute.  you finish watching supergirls and then watch happy boys.  you're just a dedicated viewer of hunan satellite tv."</seg>
<seg id="5"> i said that was true.</seg>
<seg id="6"> ying said she had seen some of the selection programs for the boys, and thought they were all girly boys.  i also thought the same, but i told her that the top four contestants had been selected from the five on happy boys.  next week three will be selected from the four.  they were singing really well, each of them was excellent.</seg>
<seg id="7"> ying, who studies popular culture and consumer culture, also said excitedly that she would have a look too next week.  after all, we had got to the most critical stage of the competition, and it would definitely be worth watching.  and taking an interest in this would also be good for stocking up on some examples for future research.</seg>
<seg id="8"> then we started talking again about how this is an era of male beauty.</seg>
<seg id="9"> men have finally turned from "spectators" into "the spectated," whereas, women, who had previously been the object, have become the subject.  they can appreciate and face various male talent shows in this era of male beauty from the perspective of the observer.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ying said this was women's liberation, a sign of feminism.</seg>
<seg id="11"> then next she said, "don't you think you are now having a very feminist life?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> when i heard what ying said, i was so amused that i laughed out loud.</seg>
<seg id="13"> this remark itself is filled with the meaning of feminism, it's just that i don't have a good  capacity for analysis like ying's that can explain all these things more deeply and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i like chen chusheng's singing on happy boys very much.  it's got a very special texture, a power to pierce space and time right to your heart; it's very pure and very comforting.</seg>
<seg id="15"> su xing sings in many different styles, and is full of feeling.  he looks handsome and cultured, but he gives you a lively, relaxed feeling.</seg>
<seg id="16"> zhang jie sings with great clarity and power, and particularly the two songs he nailed today, "the way you look" and "past goes with the wind," are both old songs that i like very much, they left a deep impression.</seg>
<seg id="17"> wei chen has a cute, innocent face that extremely resembles lu yi's.  it's said that he attracts a lot of girls, and of course his voice isn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the next clash between these four strong competitors should be very good to watch.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i'm looking forward to watching their great performances next week.</seg>

<seg id="1"> random thoughts on kimchi, june 29</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: kimchi, seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> random thoughts on kimchi, june 29  i switched on international roaming, but when i got off the plane, my cell phone seemed to have had its power cut.  it still didn't have even one bar of signal.  maybe gsm's effective coverage means the scope of the "heart," and it will be effective from the next billing date.</seg>
<seg id="4"> these few days, i'm going to lose contact with everyone temporarily.  haha, will there be anyone who worries about me because of this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> i've turned on their secretary system, just want to be sure who's missing me.</seg>
<seg id="6"> it doesn't matter if it's business or personal.</seg>
<seg id="7"> but the question is, who am i hoping will miss me?</seg>
<seg id="8"> my heart has turned completely blank again.  i don't know when it started.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i don't understand why there are always some people that you want to keep hold of but can't, and some people that you don't want to keep hold of but who always think that they can squeeze themselves in.  is it like when you're talking about markets?</seg>
<seg id="10"> but can i always let the "white gloves" block up my heart, no matter whether or not there is a place for you?</seg>
<seg id="11"> but substance and heart cannot be talked about as if they were the same after all!</seg>
<seg id="12"> our car is driving along the expressway to busan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> our department head is driving silently, and i don't have anything to say.</seg>
<seg id="14"> anyway, he doesn't understand chinese and doesn't understand english, either, and me, i can only speak a very few very awkward sentences of english.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i'm looking at the computer, rather bored, punching the keyboard.  in the car, apart from the sound of the keyboard, there's only the pleasant voice of a korean girl giving directions on the gprs.  everything is too -- rather silent.</seg>
<seg id="16"> outside the window, all that's left to see is never-ending green and a grey-blue sky.</seg>
<seg id="17"> silence is unusual for my personality.</seg>
<seg id="18"> what i hadn't expected is that the only thing in this country that gives me a sense of fellow feeling is actually english.</seg>
<seg id="19"> apart from making me dizzy like from radiation, those little circles i see everywhere have no other function at all.</seg>
<seg id="20"> i think south korea definitely will not produce compasses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> because there's no demand in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22"> seoul is very clean, thoroughly clean, unfailingly clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> it's just a pity that in the few days i am in seoul, i won't have time to go anywhere but my workplace and the department store.  my entire impression is limited to what i see along the streets.</seg>
<seg id="24"> luckily, everything was still very good!</seg>
<seg id="25"> koreans are polite in a traditional way.  they smile meticulously, listen carefully.  they're elegant and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="26"> everything i've been able to notice is the beautiful surface: traditional customs, ancient architectural styles, and absolutely scrupulous courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="27"> is this hypocritical?</seg>
<seg id="28"> then it's better to be a bit hypocritical, at least everyone is polite!</seg>
<seg id="29"> if you don't see the ugly things, maybe you'll think they don't exist.</seg>
<seg id="30"> korean cuisine is really amazing!</seg>
<seg id="31"> it's just that i don't like it.  i don't understand why they suffer themselves going back and forth, when it's only kimchi in various forms and on an assortment platter.  of course, there must be seaweed.</seg>
<seg id="32"> then, thinking again about it, the amount that korean people know about their cuisine is still very awesome.  they can tell the difference between kimchi that's been pickled above ground and underground or for different lengths of time, and with up to minute precision.</seg>
<seg id="33"> this shows, from one perspective, that the seriousness of koreans might have something to do with the kimchi served from morning till night.</seg>
<seg id="34"> my only headache is that i don't know what kind of recipe with kimchi again somehow integrated will it have at the japanese tofu restaurant that the head of department is going to take us to.</seg>
<seg id="35"> thinking of the chinese food last night, i feel like i want to cry.  it was completely koreanized.  the only thing i could eat turned out to be kimchi.</seg>
<seg id="36"> a-ha, thanks to china southern airlines co. and the kimchi it offers together with its in-flight meals.</seg>
<seg id="37"> the airline must think that i want to start getting used to it from the moment i get on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="38"> two more days before i will go back to my country.  if there still isn't anyone to miss, then i can still miss a meal of auntie's braised pork!</seg>
<seg id="39"> after all, satisfaction for the stomach comes a bit more directly than for the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> of course, it has nothing at all to do with kimchi.</seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> two trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> two trees: one is me, one was my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> we gave each other shade, and looked after each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> in my generation they all have a lot of children, but i only have sisters, no brothers.  so the presence of my brother-in-law seemed extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="5"> we both come from poor backgrounds.  we had to take part in doing a lot of domestic chores when we were very small.  even though i always worked hard to act like a man and wanted to do my work like an expert, i never ever got my father's' approval.</seg>
<seg id="6"> ever since i was small, i've suffered from sleepwalking, but it wasn't too serious.  but when i was doing work around the house, it's hard to stop my mind wandering.</seg>
<seg id="7"> for example, my father told me to put some plaster on the chimney at our old house.  i nimbly climbed up onto the roof to do it.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the chimney got plastered ok, but when it rained, water leaked into the room.  the reason was that i had trodden on and broken the roof tiles.</seg>
<seg id="9"> another example, my father told me to change a light bulb, one of those old-fashioned incandescent bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="10"> when i'd climbed onto the stool, the light bulb in my hand slipped from my hand, fell onto the concrete and smashed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i've got countless examples like this, so when my brother-in-law came to live with us, he naturally took over these various little jobs, and did them really beautifully and with no need to pay any labor cost.</seg>
<seg id="12"> and i gleefully hid in a corner reading light novels thick as bricks.</seg>
<seg id="13"> later we grew up into two trees, two trees big enough to support the home of a family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> and my father could not stop himself shrinking.  sitting in a wheelchair, he became a quiet bush in the leafy shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> no-one expected that things suddenly changed: at 50, my brother-in-law suddenly contracted a serious illness.  that great tree, so vital and bushy on the surface, came so close to that terrifying death in a way that was hard to believe.</seg>
<seg id="16"> on that summer's day, the sunlight bright enough to knock you out, the doctor outside the operating room at peking union medical college hospital said casually: it's not worth operating.</seg>
<seg id="17"> he can survive another two months at the most.</seg>
<seg id="18"> at that moment it was like i'd been hit by a stray bullet.  my spirit left my body for an instant, and i stood there blankly like an idiot.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i started sleepwalking again.  i saw the old courtyard in our home, and the shadow of my young brother-in-law busy in the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="20"> it was the shrill sound of my elder sister's crying that woke me up.  i hastily ran to hug my sister, who slumped into sitting on the floor of the hospital corridor, and as we hugged the tears were streaming down our faces.</seg>
<seg id="21"> the bright sunshine suddenly disappeared, and wave after wave of blackness appeared in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="22"> after we came back from beijing to our city here, my brother-in-law very quickly found out what his condition was.  after he and my sister cried together for a while, his mood lightened instead.</seg>
<seg id="23"> my brother-in-law started to methodically arrange for what would happen after his death.  for example, he told his son: look after your grandmother for me.  when the old lady dies, she wants to be buried in the same grave as your grandfather; and how to open the grave when the remains are put together.</seg>
<seg id="24"> go and see your maternal grandfather often, and buy him some useful things when it's the new year or holidays.</seg>
<seg id="25"> for example, he told my younger sister: when i'm gone, you should often come and see your sister, she is sure to be extremely lonely on her own.</seg>
<seg id="26"> i took as much time as i could to go and see him, but when he saw me his expression was one of shame.</seg>
<seg id="27"> we often had nothing to say, just as two plants that have life but have no ability to converse.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these are two adult trees.  experience of wind and rain has made us able to face hardship calmly.  do you need to pass anything more on to me?</seg>
<seg id="29"> it seemed there was no need.</seg>
<seg id="30"> because in your heart you know: after you've gone, my sister, the children you and my sister had, and this big family can only rely on the tree that is me to support them alone.</seg>
<seg id="31"> no-one forced me to be a man.</seg>
<seg id="32"> being a man, whether you want to or not, you must brace your back without hesitation and take up the burden.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the only pity is: why did your tree have to wither so very early?  you should have had a full and flourishing old age.</seg>
<seg id="34"> the day you went was the first day of the new year.</seg>
<seg id="35"> just at the time when all the chinese people in the world were rejoicing and welcoming the new spring, you left, alone.</seg>
<seg id="36"> perhaps in another space and time, another living baby sprout has just been born?</seg>

<seg id="1"> x minutes of my life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> the reason for such a trendy-looking title is that at that moment of extreme desperation, my racing brain had no chance to take note of the time.</seg>
<seg id="3"> like an innocent person who receives a death penalty judgment out of the blue - would he still calmly and leisurely pick over the grammatical errors in the "verdict?"</seg>
<seg id="4"> it was a winter's day, and it was very cold in the youth center.</seg>
<seg id="5"> and i don't know whose duty day it was, but the heater hadn't been fired up for a day.</seg>
<seg id="6"> because there was word of a strong earthquake, when we went home in the evening, we were also reluctant to restart the fire.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on the long plank-bed that could sleep 12 people, we four wrapped ourselves in cotton-padded quilts and while shivering, played a poker game of "three-on-one" under the dim lamplight to win food coupons.</seg>
<seg id="8"> suddenly a noise thundered towards us from afar.  we few looked at one another for just an instant, then immediately realized that a disaster had struck.</seg>
<seg id="9"> then we threw down the cards in our hands, flew down to the floor and through the two narrow doorways, scrambled to get out.</seg>
<seg id="10"> just at the moment that we ran out of the dormitory, the poor thatched dwelling built with stones disintegrated in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="11"> we had rushed out into the yard, and it was like we were standing on a pitching and rolling boat.  we fell back and forth like weebles and couldn't anchor ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="12"> within a few seconds, all of the buildings around us, +unlike the sedate images of days past, let out a strange "jiaah" noise one after another as they danced a half-crazed break dance before collapsing on themselves in a puff of smoke and dust.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the power cables above our heads naturally couldn't bear being the odd ones out, and snapped "crack crack," then fled like whips in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> meanwhile, in front of us and behind us, the rampaging quake demon was setting off ceremonial fireworks to celebrate his own creation.  the spectacular earthquake lights could rival the stage effects in any major war movie, and the rumbling sound of the earth was like war drums urging on the fighting.  they tortured every weakened nerve.</seg>
<seg id="15"> at that time we only had one idea: the human race's last day had come!</seg>
<seg id="16"> i could imagine it: the earth under our feet would open up with a crash, and boiling lava like molten steel would issue its flaming invitation, and humans, like bugs, would be cast in free-fall into the lava one after another.  too stingy to give off a whiff of blue smoke, they would vanish in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="17"> my spine felt comfortably numb, as though it had been injected with freezing water.  in the ashy darkness the faces of my companions floated unsteadily like paper masks.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i was thinking: is this how humanity bids farewell to this wonderful world?  will tens of thousands of years of civilization vanish without a trace now?</seg>
<seg id="19"> but i wasn't yet 20 years old!  the blossom of my youth had only just started to bloom, and i had only just perceived the joy of existence.  i was so unwilling to leave beautiful life!</seg>
<seg id="20"> and my parents, my family?  where are you?  what are you now doing?  are you still living in this world?</seg>
<seg id="21"> at the moment when i faced the savage grinning face of death, i missed you so much!</seg>
<seg id="22"> ...in my confusion, i don't know how long it was before i finally realized with joy that the sound of the earthquake was getting quieter little by little, the shaking of the earth was slowing little by little, and the fireworks were also no longer sparkling above my head.</seg>
<seg id="23"> a tanker, tossing on stormy seas, finally slowly sailed into a calm harbor.</seg>
<seg id="24"> a young and easily breakable heart was carefully returned to its original state after going through a manic ransacking.</seg>
<seg id="25"> oh, earth, my home, you've finally allowed us to feel again a home's warmth and closeness!</seg>
<seg id="26"> a feeling of survivor's luck ran slowly like warm water from beneath my feet through my whole body.</seg>
<seg id="27"> when yu doudou, who had just turned 17, could stand steadily, she faced the yard of the youth center that had once been calm and warm, but now was all broken-down ruins, and suddenly started sobbing loudly.</seg>
<seg id="28"> everyone was infected, and hot tears flowed everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="29"> snow started to fall from the sky.  was it a lament floating down for the misfortunes of humanity?</seg>
<seg id="30"> that year, the haicheng earthquake claimed the lives of as many as 1,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31"> an expert said: it's lucky the forecasts came in time, and that it happened before people had gone to bed, otherwise the strong earthquake, measuring 7.3, would have claimed the lives of at least 100,000 people!</seg>
<seg id="32"> only a year later, the tangshan earthquake erupted, and more than 200,000 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1"> the things that go on in the village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> there are many households in the village.  of them all, the members of a family called south are the most disliked.  in the village there's a common saying that goes: guard against fire, guard against robbery, and guard against the souths.</seg>
<seg id="3"> actually, the south family are pretty honest.</seg>
<seg id="4"> some people steal a melon or something from someone else's land at any time.  and the south family are just committing some petty theft at the worst and do not deserve to be isolated by the whole village.</seg>
<seg id="5"> no-one has clean hands, so who have we souths offended?</seg>
<seg id="6"> the souths started to organize some very worthy activities, showing that this village was first established by the ancestors of the south family, that the souths had always been a major rice-growing family, and that they had produced quite a number of famous people in history.  in addition, they had made a great contribution to improving the village.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at that same time, the souths warmly invited the village cadres to their home to have a look and sit for a while.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in all, the south family are very aspiring and proactive, striving to be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, the west family did something very disgraceful.  they damaged the souths' young crops very badly.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the family called west are known throughout the village for matchmaking.  all of the young guys in the village have something to thank the wests for.</seg>
<seg id="11"> if it weren't for the good matchmaking of the wests, how would each of you families and households be able to take good care of production?</seg>
<seg id="12"> but this time, the wests bashed down the souths' young crops with illegal bricks in a place called hongdong.  it was truly terrible, and the whole village was furious.  they all said that there are no good people in the west family.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the souths demanded an explanation from the wests, attracting the sympathy of everyone in the village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> everyone in the village poured abuse on the wests.</seg>
<seg id="15"> thus, the battlefield shifted to the west's house.</seg>
<seg id="16"> the souths were determined to project a good image before the 17th village meeting, to make the south family, which is most populous and thriving, developed.</seg>
<seg id="17"> even though the cadres in the village urge everyone to get along harmoniously with one another every day, this village named china is never peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the most annoying thing is, in just three short months, even the pigs have started oinking crazily and stirring up trouble.  they want to raise their price!</seg>
<seg id="19"> two years ago, the chickens in every village were squawking about catching a cold.  didn't they all get killed?</seg>
<seg id="20"> pigs, why don't you think?</seg>
<seg id="21"> if you talk about calling for a revolution again, you'll have no way of avoiding the chop!</seg>
<seg id="22"> meanwhile, the america village and britain village that are used to bullying people don't seem peaceable either even though they are wealthy.</seg>
<seg id="23"> there are a few vagabonds who knocked down the tall building in america village today and will throw some exploding pots in the metro in britain village tomorrow.  it's enough to make anyone frightened, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="24"> because of this, most people in china village think that even though it is terrible not to be able to afford a place to stay, not to be able to afford to go to the doctor and not to be able to afford to go to school, if they can peacefully farm some land, do some jobs, make a few connections, then they have already entered a new era.</seg>
<seg id="25"> the souths, the wests - what family hasn't got skeletons in its cupboard?</seg>
<seg id="26"> just take the wan family, who live in a little +bay to the southeast of the village.  even though the head of that household is a bit shameless, isn't our great china village willing to take this family in all the same?</seg>
<seg id="27"> looking to the 2008 inter-village sports contest that will be held in our china village, let's have less of the bad things that have happened in the village, and let's deal with the bad kids in the village.</seg>
<seg id="28"> every family, every household, light the lamps and stoke the fires.  if you have money, give money; if you can work, then work.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when the time comes, everyone goes to the village common to see a golden egg laid in the bird's nest!</seg>
<seg id="30"> (offscreen, fading out: a golden egg or a silver egg?  to all our viewers, to all our viewers, i'm your host on village tv, brother yong...)</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: eric, google, google, china  poster: an ordinary google (google) employee</seg>
<seg id="3"> i'm an employee who joined google china relatively early.  in the last two years, we've gone through a lot of challenges.  some we had predicted when they arrived; others really were beyond what we had imagined at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4"> yesterday, i heard that in this quarter's financial report the company had a section talking specially about china's development, and i happened to hear eric reply to a question about china.  this gave me a lot to think about, so i'm translating it as encouragement for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> this remark was made by google (google) ceo eric when he was replying to a question by a reporter during the google inc. second quarter 2007 earnings conference call (google second quarter 2007 earnings conference call) (http://investor.google.com/earnings.html), saying that he is absolutely satisfied with the results that google china has achieved so far, and that he is full of confidence about google's prospects for development in the chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> eric says that in china we have top-quality people, ever-improving facilities, and constantly enriched localized product lines.</seg>
<seg id="7"> he thinks that even though google's success is not yet necessarily visible, as far as google china is concerned, it's been an excellent beginning, and that with hard work from the china team, support from headquarters, and a dauntless spirit, he firmly believes that in the future google will achieve astonishing success in china.</seg>
<seg id="8"> that's true.  what's important is that we keep forging onwards and upwards.  because we grew up here, we have deep feelings for this place, and we deeply believe that google should give china more, more; that it should give its users more, more.</seg>

<seg id="3"> you maybe already knew that t-backs, which have been fashionable for many years, have been defeated by g-strings, because the latter doesn't have any straps at all.</seg>
<seg id="4"> so in an age like this, the flip-flops you're wearing on your feet may now be behind the times, because now an all-new kind of strapless flip-flop has appeared.  it's only got a sole.</seg>
<seg id="5"> how do you wear it if it's got no straps?</seg>
<seg id="6"> we're not gods, and the manufacturer can't do magic.</seg>
<seg id="7"> this flip-flop... sticks directly to the sole of your foot.  this is no spoof product, this is a real item in the shops.  the price is about 13.5 us dollars a pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this is another "i've imagined it existing, but never imagined that it really did exist" product.  it leaves me dumbfounded.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the manufacturer thinks this kind of flip-flop is amazingly cool.  don't believe me?</seg>

<seg id="2"> key words: cell phone</seg>
<seg id="3"> korean company iljin display has brought out a laser projector module no bigger than a coin.</seg>
<seg id="4"> because the module is so small in size, this kind of projector module could even be installed in a cell phone.  on a wall, you can see a projection seven inches in size.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) traditional projectors include three different lcd screens, each responsible for outputting a different video signal: red, green and blue.  but this mini-projector can switch among the three colors by using only a single lcd screen.  this way it has cut the size and production costs of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> an official statement says that the lcd screen in this projector is only 0.24 inches in size, and could very easily be integrated into a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> currently more than half of the cell phones on the market include a camera, and it is estimated that cell phones with internal projectors will soon appear on the market.  but whether the market will embrace them is really very difficult to say.</seg>

<seg id="3"> the central commission for discipline inspection gave people guilty of corruption across the country a one-month deadline from may 30, that is until june 30, to confess on their own initiative. if they do not do so within the time limit, then they will be arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i, a common folk, could not help laughing when i learned about this. a month before the police arrest the thief, they told him to confess immediately on his own initiative, or else they will arrest him. where on earth does such anti-corruption work exist???</seg>
<seg id="5"> isn't it the same as explicitly tell the corrupt officials to run quickly and transfer the evidence of crime immediately???</seg>
<seg id="6"> what is the intention?</seg>
<seg id="7"> wouldn't that......well, i simply cannot say it.</seg>
<seg id="8"> then again, even if it really works, what will be the result?</seg>
<seg id="9"> can it check and frighten the corrupt officials?</seg>
<seg id="10"> we do not rule out there are timid ones among them who will confess on their own initiative. however, wouldn't there be more who escape?</seg>
<seg id="11"> not to mention whether or not the result will be remarkable when the deadline of the central commission for discipline inspection arrives, i am afraid that it will produce another effect instead.</seg>
<seg id="12"> that is, corrupt officials everywhere will all understand tacitly and rejoice secretly. they will all thank the central commission for discipline inspection.</seg>
<seg id="13"> there is enough time to quickly transfer the assets in a month.</seg>
<seg id="14"> if i were a corrupt official, i would definitely think so as well. i would never declare it to you on my initiative either.</seg>
<seg id="15"> after considering themselves lucky, corrupt officials will also act this way: haha, thank you......</seg>
<seg id="16"> the people are indeed puzzled. what exactly happened to anti-corruption work? why is it so difficult to act vigorously, swiftly, and resolutely?</seg>
<seg id="17"> furthermore, how effective will such anti-corruption work be?</seg>
<seg id="18"> in short, central commission of discipline inspection, i worry about the result of your limited time combat against corruption.</seg>

<seg id="3"> non-privatization of land is bottom line for my even temper</seg>
<seg id="4"> i believe i do not get angry easily. at least this is how i feel.</seg>
<seg id="5"> when speaking at the forum, i have always been rational and even-tempered regardless. i seldom lose my senses and talk nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i have also kept my strong faith and ardent expectations in the party central committee all along. no matter how inconsistent the reform measures are with my ideas, i can still accept them and consider them as one of the "special features".</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, if privatization of land starts (or covert privatization), then all these will lose the basis on which they exist.</seg>
<seg id="8"> rather lose 1,000 soldiers than an inch of land. only land and resources are the largest social resources.</seg>
<seg id="9"> working people and land and resources are the essence of a country.</seg>
<seg id="10"> as long as the nature of land and resources remains unchanged, then it is very difficult to change the nature of this country. well, everything basically changes once the nature of land and resources changes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i am not a communist party member. however, i clearly remember that i made the following pledges: "cherish my country, love my people deeply, study hard, train well, and be prepared to: devote my strength to the cause of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="12"> "study diligently, work zealously, first to bear hardship, last to enjoy comfort, and fight for the cause of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="13"> people who once made such pledges and called out "we are successors of socialism" loudly like i did, if you are still not shameless enough, then you should remember the pledges that you once made.</seg>
<seg id="14"> if you have already broken your own pledges, please stand up with a quiet conscience and walk away from "communism". don't embrace this signboard to deceive the masses while ponder how to sell it for a better price at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="15"> of course, i wish all these worries were uncalled for. i wish i could keep my senses and composure forever.</seg>
<seg id="16"> remember, "we are successors of socialism."</seg>
<seg id="17"> what if there is nothing to take over from?</seg>

<seg id="1"> a generation with two eras of feelings</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> a while ago, someone asked if there are any mao supporters among the 30-year-olds?</seg>
<seg id="3"> it was later changed to 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="4"> in fact, people in this age bracket have not experienced the mao zedong era at all. i am not sure whether the brain of the person who raised this question was filled with water or he is born retarded.</seg>
<seg id="5"> in the cities, people who are best qualified to speak on the mao zedong era should be those who had personally experienced it, those who had suffered agonies of that era. in other words, they should be those who were born between 1950 and 1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> after they were born, their parents joined the movement and did not give their children relative love.</seg>
<seg id="7"> when they needed nutrition, they were just in time for three years of natural disasters and they suffered from starvation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> when they started school, once again, they encountered the cultural revolution and neglected a few years of studies.</seg>
<seg id="9"> some even ended their studies all their lives. they were between 15 and 17 years old. their studies had not been finished but they were forced to give them up to answer the call of the party by working in the countryside or mountain areas and supporting the frontier.</seg>
<seg id="10"> after they started working, they believed that the working class was the most honorable so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and the most tiring jobs.</seg>
<seg id="11"> they enjoyed a short period of glory but have been a looser all their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12"> when they reached the age of marriage, late marriage, late childbearing, and having one child also started from them.</seg>
<seg id="13"> +when their salaries should be increased, businesses stress diplomas. their salaries were not raised because they did not have any diploma.</seg>
<seg id="14"> they worked hard to raise their children until they were grown. after they finished supporting their children through their basic education and the children were admitted to universities, they again encountered the double jeopardy of educational system reform and state-owned business reform. tuition fees rose. they were laid off.</seg>
<seg id="15"> with the increase in age each day, they started to get sick. unfortunately, they are just in time for the healthcare system reform again. as a result, their illnesses are not treated because they cannot afford the medical expenses.</seg>
<seg id="16"> as we can see: all social injustices have fallen on this generation of people mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="17"> however, not many of these people oppose and attack mao zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> they are not slaves of mao zedong. they are human beings with flesh and blood and they are a human group living in our society. the history that they personally experienced, from working in the countryside and mountain areas to being laid off, +are squarely the social phenomena of two eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> despite their huge resentment and even hatred of the negligence of studies, the lack of food and clothing, and certain undesirable phenomena in society during the mao zedong era, they still think that the mao zedong era was good judging from national spirit, ethics and morals, as well as social conduct.</seg>
<seg id="21"> parents of some net friends are exactly this generation of people. you can chat with them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "injected watermelons", "cancerous bananas", and "carton buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [saiwaihuangyuan] posted on 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send text messages] [table view] i remember there was news two years ago about watermelons in hainan being injected with chemicals with syringes. as a result, it caused a large batch of watermelons in hainan to rot on the ground and many melon farmers to lose every cent they invested.</seg>
<seg id="3"> cctv later conducted a follow-up report and the result confirmed that this matter simply did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the report was bizarre from the very beginning because not only was it of no practical significance to inject each watermelon with syringe, it was impossible judging from the workload as well.</seg>
<seg id="5"> my memory from last year is even clearer. there were media reports stating that the banana trees in hainan had suffered from a disease similar to human cancer and banana tress that got sick could not avoid dying.</seg>
<seg id="6"> as a result, many people misunderstood that eating bananas would develop cancer. the consequence was the same. the price of bananas in hainan plummeted, causing banana farmers inexpressible anxieties and endless complaints.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the reason the two reports mentioned above both created sensational effects was that they had directly touched the most sensitive nerve of people, which was food safety issue.</seg>
<seg id="8"> if the media say that certain kind of food will endanger health, then word will definitely spread. people generally adopt the attitude of rather believe it to be true than not toward targets involved. for a person, after all, it is not a matter of life and death to eat a few less watermelons, bananas, and what not from hainan. however, for the producers and distributors of those products, the impacts are truly serious.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, exciting news on food safely broke out in beijing again. simply due to an increase in pork price, someone actually used processed carton as stuffing to make buns. this was precisely the carton buns.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i was also deeply shocked after hearing this. i felt that the peddlers were so good at exploration that they could actually think of such a method to cheat people. i also widely spread %pw, this news afterwards and warned my family and friends not to buy any bun when they went out.</seg>
<seg id="11"> however, suddenly, there was news again yesterday stating that the carton bun report was false news. the entire incident was fabricated by one person. thus, while feeling relieved, i also wondered what happened to the media nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the truth i learned from a reliable channel was that a certain zi, a temporary personnel of the column crew of transparency of the beijing television life channel, brought the minced meat stuffing, flour, and carton he bought from the market himself and instructed people including a certain wei to mix the carton into the minced meat stuffing after soaking it in water and make it into buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> a certain zi used the home dv camera that he brought along to shoot the production process. he edited it afterwards and used deception to have the video broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14"> currently, the public security organ has put a certain zi in custody according to law and will handle the case seriously in conformity of legal provisions.</seg>
<seg id="15"> after the case of the bun happened, the government quickly organized relevant departments to launch investigations. it also conducted comprehensive and thorough inspection of the breakfast markets in beijing to ensure the safety of the dining table of the people.</seg>
<seg id="16"> after the incident was confirmed, the beijing television had publicly apologized to society. it had learned a profound lesson and had strictly dealt with relevant people responsible. it will also further enhance its management to stop the loophole and end false news stories with determination.</seg>
<seg id="17"> however, even though carton bun was completely unreal, it is still unclear when people will feel at ease to buy buns from stalls again.</seg>
<seg id="18"> this incident also indirectly reflected the great importance the government attached to food safety and its promptness in action. to a certain extent, it also illustrated that the dining table of beijing people is relatively safe. the bun incident was a false alarm. it could be considered as a reminder to people as well!</seg>

<seg id="1"> to whom should education be accountable?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> i recently heard a friend in china talked about a story of a school. it provoked my reflections and i could not refrain from expressing them.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the incident happened at a private middle school in shanghai city - southwest weiyu middle school.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the school decided to assign the best teachers to the three classes that signed a contract to directly promote from its own junior to senior high school. meanwhile, it let a few young teachers who had no high school senior class teaching experience with poor teaching results in the past to lead the other few classes that were admitted to the school from outside schools or those who were promoted without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="5"> its reason was: students who signed a contract at that time agreed to abstain from applying for other senior high schools. therefore, based on the agreement, the school had to assure that it would provide them with the best teachers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> while for students of the other few classes, the position of the school was: young teachers should be given training opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="7"> i could not help but to sigh. after all, to whom is education accountable?</seg>
<seg id="8"> i remember many years ago when i attended a key senior high school, because of the dissatisfaction with the teaching standard of a math teacher, the entire class signed a collective request to ask the school to change the teacher without understanding the difficulty of things.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the school actually changed the teacher for us in the end because the commitment of the school to us was to treat every student fairly and to be accountable to every student.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i came to the united states to attend graduate school 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="11"> when i was selecting courses for the next semester one summer, i found that the elective courses planned by the department were all theoretical-based courses while application-based courses were not scheduled at all.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i went to talk to the chair of the department and told him that i believed there was a problem with the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the chairman of the department acknowledged that due to a shortage in teachers, application-based course was not offered. however, it would be offered in a year or two once teachers were available.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i remember i told him then, "this is your problem, not mine.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i came afar from shanghai to attend your school precisely because i was attracted by your course description.</seg>
<seg id="16"> if you are incapable of offering these courses, then do not put them in your description. otherwise, it is false advertisement. you are being irresponsible to me and my family."</seg>
<seg id="17"> after hearing what i said, the chair of the department thought for a moment, then said, "well, i will see what i can do to resolve this.</seg>
<seg id="18"> it may be too late because all courses have been scheduled for online registration."</seg>
<seg id="19"> the chairman of the department talked to me three weeks later. the gist was to tell me that his job was to be accountable to every student including me.</seg>
<seg id="20"> after listening to my opinion, he tried his best to add two application-based elective courses. he hoped that i could understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> i took a few courses taught by the chairman of the department after this incident.</seg>
<seg id="22"> he never held any prejudice against me just because i had lodged a complaint to him. he gave me an a fairly in each course.</seg>
<seg id="23"> on the eve of graduation, i heard his secretary mentioned that he tried his best for every student but not every student was grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="24"> at the graduation ceremony, as the representative of the honors students, i told the chairman of the department in my speech that we all thanked him for all he had done for us from our hearts because he had tried his best to be accountable to every one of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i believed that i had made the right choice in life to choose to study there.</seg>
<seg id="26"> when i said this, i could faintly see that the chairman of the department had tears in his eyes... if one day, all educators in china and the entire educational system can both be accountable to every student, then i believe the day that china actually makes rapid progress will be in sight.</seg>

<seg id="1"> central ny men's 4s volleyball tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> i took part in the central ny men's 4s volleyball tournament last sunday. after playing for six and a half hours, our team finally won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the tournament was in fact a scrimmage organized to prepare us for entering the volleyball competition in the empire state summer games.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the coach broke up the four men's competing teams in central new york region (high school team, college team, 35-and-up team, and 45-and-up team) and regrouped us into four people a team with a setter in each team to compete.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the rules of the tournament were very interesting. only the back row could attack. fake hit to inside the 3-meter line was prohibited. the setter alone could block with no position substitution.</seg>
<seg id="6"> therefore, it was basically a test of powerful offense capabilities as well as decision making and jockey for position in defense.</seg>
<seg id="7"> our team had: a 2-meter tall opposite hitter whose offense was a strong point as well as from a high point. he was responsible for over 60 percent of the offense and the scores of the entire match; a 1.85-meter tall setter who blocked many balls dead by himself;</seg>
<seg id="8"> a 1.90-meter tall middle hitter who missed quite a bit of his offense since he was at the back row;</seg>
<seg id="9"> and me, a 1.75-meter tall outside hitter who launched surprise offense from time to time. my success rate was not bad. i was mainly responsible for receiving the opponent's crosscourt smash.</seg>
<seg id="10"> there were seven teams in total. first, we had the round robin. after our team won the first game, the ref repeatedly ruled that our opposite hitter fouled for stepping on the line during offense. this largely affected our team's morale. we were smashed and lost three games in a roll.</seg>
<seg id="11"> however, we calmed down after our losses. our coordination had also stabilized during these three games. as a result, we began our winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the round robin ended. our team had three wins and three losses. we were in the sixth place based on the ratio between the total points we scored and the total points we lost.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the supplementary matches followed. apart from the top-seeded team, teams from the second to the seventh place played elimination games in pairs.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the mentality and strategies of our team were stable. we played strong and led all the way to enter the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> in the semi-finals, our opponents had strong offense but weak defense. my shoulders were bruised from the hitting. however, once i dug a spike, i was twice as happy as when i successfully spiked a ball myself.</seg>
<seg id="16"> i did not even know what the final score was. we just won.</seg>
<seg id="17"> in the finals, our opponent had balanced offense and defense. our serves foiled their offense quite a bit and we led all the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> when it was 21:24 in the end, our team had the match point. i received two successive serves from the other team but hit the ball out of bounce at both times. it was 23:24. our team's opposite hitter ran toward me and said, "no problem. it was only two balls."</seg>
<seg id="19"> the next ball flew toward me again. fortunately, i received it well. the setter did a backward pass to the opposite hitter and ended the battle with a spike.</seg>

<seg id="6"> in these occasions, certain morality is required for a group.</seg>
<seg id="7"> we can often find certain good morality among groups that have succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this is not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> it is because for these businesses or activities to overcome certain immediate difficulties, to unite and put aside religious-based factors, i believe good morality also play a role that cannot be overlooked.</seg>
<seg id="10"> at the least, it can be predicted with great confidence that a group of people with low moral standard can hardly accomplish any successful great deeds together.</seg>
<seg id="11"> perhaps it is because wisdom to see long-term benefits with rational long-range perspective is a necessary quality for a group to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in fact, groups always employ various means to acquire identity such as logo, jargon, religion, so on, and also morality.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [discussion] throughout your life, how many times have you been truly happy?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> my good friend from senior high school finally got her visa and can set off to attend graduate school at a famous university in the west coast of the united states at the end of august.</seg>
<seg id="3"> a few of our classmates had a little get-together today. we were really happy for her that her wish could finally come true.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i truly envied her when i saw how happy she was.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i thought, throughout my life, the only time i was that happy was when i was admitted to senior high school. at that time, i had never imagined that i would be admitted to a famous school that was one of the best in the city. afterwards, i attended university and work as a matter of course. i had never been so happy again during that time.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i was admitted to a university but it was not the one that i had longed for before, so i was by no means very happy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> my only hope during university was to be able to go to the north after graduation to join my boyfriend, whom i had been in love with for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> however, the creator played trick on me. one month before i graduated, he suggested to part. all the illusions that i had before went up in smoke.</seg>
<seg id="9"> after that, i simply returned to the north to work. now, i have been working for almost two years and have made enough money to buy a midrange car. however, i have never been that happy again.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i had a deep understanding of my good friend's happiness when i chatted with her today. she had been preparing this gingerly and with efforts for a year. finally, she can go abroad to begin a new life without much trouble. the feeling of having one's dream fulfilled really makes one very happy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i have no plan to further my study, nor do i like living abroad either because i had worked abroad for half a year before and found that the life abroad did not suit me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> when i saw my good friend's happiness, i could not help but to ponder, "what about my pursuit?"</seg>
<seg id="13"> "how can i make myself so happy again?"</seg>
<seg id="14"> perhaps it is to find someone who truly likes me and is willing to spend the rest of his life with me.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i think i will be moved to tears at that time, just like my good friend told me that when she passed the interview at the embassy and got the approval notice, she could not refrain herself from crying. the yearlong efforts and worries were finally paid off.</seg>
<seg id="16"> then, what about me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> time and again, i act with caution and give attention to my relationship. when can my wish also come true so i can cry with joy?</seg>
<seg id="18"> perhaps i am not promising. i never worry about my own career, but about relationship...</seg>
<seg id="19"> when will my relationship find its destination?</seg>
<seg id="20"> i remain very sad in this matter.</seg>
<seg id="21"> fellow brothers and sisters, how about you?</seg>
<seg id="22"> throughout your life, how many times have you been truly happy?</seg>

<seg id="1"> let's promote school of architecture southeast university</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> haha, consider this an introduction of the school of architecture for the alumni of the southeast university.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this is the latest first hand information with personal experience. it is guaranteed authentic.</seg>
<seg id="4"> dean wang, secretary an, mr. li from the personnel department, and a few other teachers from the research institute of architecture participated in the report. i talked for an hour and then other people talked for approximately an hour and a half.</seg>
<seg id="5"> when the formal report ended, mr. zhang (assistant dean) pulled me aside and asked me to go talk in the back office behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="6"> he was very amicable. he closed the door and told me that it was inconvenient to say certain things at the formal meeting. he said that he could tell that i felt uncertain about future income so he told me some specific income situations of teachers at the school of architecture to ease my mind.</seg>
<seg id="7"> dean wang gave a brief account of the school of architecture before the report. he said that there are only six major architectural disciplines across the country. the southeast university has two, the qinghua university has two, the tongji university has one, the tianjin university has one, and there is none other than that.</seg>
<seg id="8"> he said that the state has put special emphasis on energy conservation in building, environmental-friendly construction, and the science of architectural technology in the past few years. the southeast university wants to recruit a teacher in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9"> he said that they had received over 20 resumes from inside the country, japan, and the united states (i seemed to be the only one) applying for that stream.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the school of architecture took this seriously. it also conducted careful examination of the job applicants.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the southeast university is indeed relatively ahead when compared to other schools of architecture at some colleges and universities that i know of. the urban planning at the tongji university  should be one better than the southeast university. however, it seems that the southeast university is a little better in the stream of architectural design (i did not expect this before).</seg>
<seg id="12"> dean wang said that in the past two years, the scientific research funding of the school of architecture has been abundant. it is a key development university under the state's 985 program.</seg>
<seg id="13"> he told me that last year, the higher-up allocated a lump-sum of 10 million yuan development funds to the school of architecture southeast university, of which 3.5 million yuan was directly spent on purchasing books to substantiate the professional library of the school of architecture (haha, i also have to praise this. how generous with spending!)</seg>
<seg id="14"> almost all of what remained was spent on the purchase of experiment equipments of my specialty.</seg>
<seg id="15"> allegedly, it made a few academicians quite dissatisfied.</seg>
<seg id="16"> haha锝烇綖锝濴et's say a few words in passing. i think that they were overcharged for some imported equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17"> there is an experiment system used for measuring air tightness of a room that is very popular in the united states. i guess it definitely cost less than us $500. as it turned out, the southeast university had paid renminbi 50,000 yuan for it!!!</seg>
<seg id="18"> other situations included that many schools and faculties at the southeast university had moved to the new campus in jiulonghu. however, the school of architecture insisted on staying, claiming that it has to provide students with a good architectural atmosphere because the old campus still has some classic structures to look at while there is none in the new campus.</seg>
<seg id="19"> haha锝烇綖锝瀞ince all other faculties had moved away, the school of architecture seemed to have acquired another building.</seg>
<seg id="20"> therefore, dean wang told me clearly from the very beginning that he can allocate an exclusive office for me in the future.</seg>
<seg id="21"> i felt very sorry that i simply was not aware of anything when dean wang mentioned this.</seg>
<seg id="22"> later, mr. zhang pulled me aside and told me that it is not an easy thing to do because there is a huge shortage in office and even some old professors do not have their separate offices.</seg>
<seg id="23"> this made me feel very uneasy. it seemed that i still knew little about the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="4"> sun yanzi accompanied the world vision to niger, africa twice after her congo trip.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at yesterday's press conference, she frankly admitted that it was the most tiring trip ever.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the local weather was hot and the drinking water was muddy. she was also stoned by angry protesting masses while visiting the market, and even riding on a camel, she was scratched.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the entire journey was filled with predicaments, which made her cried out in secret several times, "i want to go home so much!"</seg>

<seg id="9"> sun yanzi had participated in the world vision's caring for poor children activities for three consecutive years. she called herself an experienced spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="10"> she brought 30 bottles of vitamin, 40 torches, and 500 candies to share with local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> she stated that repeated experiences accumulated showed that no matter how many small gifts she brings, it will never be enough.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the most serious problem in niger is that mothers do not understand the issue of childrearing at all and children suffer from severe malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="13"> on her eight-hour road trip from the capital of niger to the small town of tahoua located 500 miles away, sun yanzi experienced a sandstorm that was rarely seen in the area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> with wind blown dust and rain, the entire sky was stormy.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the jeep she was riding on also swayed in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="16"> when sun yanzi thought about that moment, she revealed with lingering fear that even though she was inside the car, she was terrified.</seg>
<seg id="17"> she later heard the locals explained that sandstorm is a symbol of good luck. it brings rain to moisten the land. only after that did she relaxed a little.</seg>
<seg id="18"> with local residents.</seg>
<seg id="19"> pained by mothers' childrearing problem</seg>
<seg id="20"> when she arrived at tahoua, local officials held a one-humped camel welcoming ceremony and invited sun yanzi to sit on the camel to receive the cheers of the locals.</seg>
<seg id="21"> however, the camel was scared by the flashlights and was completely out of control. it nearly threw sun yanzi onto the ground.</seg>
<seg id="22"> in the end, sun yanzi jumped down by herself but her clothes were accidentally torn by the seat cushion. she cut her back and left an 8-cm long small bloody scar.</seg>
<seg id="23"> during this trip, sun yanzi visited four local sick children who were severely malnourished. among them was a four-month old baby who only weighted 2.1 kilos and did not look like a human being at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> she said, "i was very sad when i saw him. his situation was indeed very serious but it should also be the problem of the mothers. they should be taught correct nutritional concepts."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> club original: a few common phases in learning buffett: i am strolling</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) first phase: when one first learns about buffett, one will feel as if one has found a rare treasure and will immediately put it into practice. however, the shallow and incomplete understanding of buffett's conceptions always makes one misuse them, use them indiscriminately, and use them blindly. therefore, results are intermittent.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) second phase: a "breakthrough" in buffett. after a period of study and practice, almost every "wise man" will consider a few questions: for instance, how should buffett with chinese characteristics be?</seg>
<seg id="5"> should buffett's theories be applied flexibly in china?</seg>
<seg id="6"> can we do it better than buffett does?</seg>
<seg id="7"> therefore, this phase is mainly characterized by self-righteousness, blind arrogance, and the pursuit of buffett's theories with chinese characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="8"> after a period of practice, the results are still always intermittent and non-sustainable. if one is fortunate, it is best to suffer some losses and mend one's way as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) third phase: return to buffett. after a few commotions, one can finally understand that one is an ordinary person and not a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> one should have lower expectations of oneself. it is entirely enough to just learn buffett conscientiously.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the simplest is the most effective instead. nevertheless, simple methods always embody profound principles. one must understand these principles before one can better implement simplicity to the fullest.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the manifestation of this phase is having little short-term results but many long-term ones with sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4) fourth phase: "diehard" buffett. after experiencing sustainable results, one is basically incorrigibly obstinate about buffett's theories in this phase. his attitude toward non-buffett's companies is one of total disdain.</seg>
<seg id="14"> continue to study and deepen the understanding of buffett as well as put the knowledge into practice. the manifestation of this phase is continuously improved results with sustainability and the progression to a virtuous cycle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the time each person needs in each phase varies. both individual situation and luck have a bearing on it.</seg>

<seg id="1"> evils of railway stations</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> i recently traveled on train for a few days and found out the evils of railway stations in various places during summer passenger transport period!</seg>
<seg id="3"> i want to know what i need to pay attention to at railway stations in various places.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i am from changsha. let's talk about the situation in changsha first. everyone needs to pay attention when you go to the changsha railway station.</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. the forever hard to buy railway tickets: it is absolutely impossible to buy a ticket at changsha railway station at major holidays or when school ends and starts during winter and summer holidays. it is still of no avail no matter how early one waits in line.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the most flawless answer i got was that the travel agencies had booked all the tickets!</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, if one puts in extra money, one can get as many as one wants from the scalpers.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. beware of counterfeit tickets: tickets in the hands of scalpers are not necessarily real. in shuangfeng and xinhua, hunan, a person relied on fake identity cards to get rich while another relied on counterfeit silver coins and counterfeit coins to make a fortune. thus, counterfeit ticket is indeed child's play!</seg>
<seg id="9"> patching up is the most rudimentary form. some counterfeit tickets are so real that even train attendants cannot differentiate them!</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. who moved my bills: be extremely careful when buying things from stores inside the railway station!</seg>
<seg id="11"> if you want to give small bills, oh, oh, your bills always miss the corner so you have to substitute them with a large bill.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, after you substitute them with a large bill, the storeowner will say that he has no change for sure and return the bill to you. then, he will take the small bills with the missing corner. at this time, you will be forced to take a counterfeit large bill back.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. magicians give change: not all the storeowners will switch your large bills. that is a crime and the risk is higher!</seg>
<seg id="14"> therefore, some "timid" storeowners have to be magicians. you clearly see that the change that he counted is right but when you have a chance to count it yourself, oh, oh, a few bills are missing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. foreign wine everywhere: there are not too many teahouses at the railway station. however, you will find out once you enter.</seg>
<seg id="16"> a few glasses of low-grade red wine can be sold at martini's price. if you do not pay, then your mother may not be able to recognize you either.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. roses and guns: there are many video parlors around the railway station. the titles of the programs shown are very attractive to vulgar men like us regardless. thus, if you go in to watch, you will definitely be considered as distinguished guest who wants to relax a bit. as a result, a rose mm will immediately come over to accompany you. of course, you will have to be able to afford the money of five-star hotel consumption. no, broadswords do not always chop at foreigners!</seg>
<seg id="18"> ice and fire: if you have a changsha accent or if you are very familiar with changsha, then never expect to be able to hail a cab at the front terrace of the railway station. the facial expression of the taxi driver can let you know what injustice is!</seg>
<seg id="19"> however, if this is the first time you visit changsha, congratulations. even if you are going to a place that is only within five-minute walk, the driver will still take you to admire sceneries of a state-level key tourist city with enthusiasm. he will also let you inhale the famous baisha brand secondhand cigarette and smell the highly regional areca.</seg>
<seg id="20"> of course, you need to pay for your own fare, don't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> nanjing subway driver should receive immediate psychological conditioning</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key word: psychological conditioning</seg>
<seg id="3"> according to report of xinhua news agency, an incident involving a death by laying on the track happened inside the nanjing subway on the night of july 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> based on description of the reporter, "zhu zhengting, 22, is a young subway driver who had experienced a nightmarish scene. when the reporter saw him yesterday, it seemed that he still had not recovered from the shock. he sat straight on the chair and had a far-away look in his eyes."</seg>
<seg id="5"> apparently, the young driver had suffered immense psychological shock and is in need of urgent psychological conditioning. otherwise, it will leave trouble to the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i am not sure if people remember the rescuer in texas, united states who rescued a girl from an abandoned oil well more than 10 years ago. after experiencing prolonged mental distress, he eventually chose suicide to end his painful life.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at that time, even though he had undergone simple psychological conditioning, people paid more attention to the girl who was rescued and simply neglected the person who needed psychological conditioning more. the tragedy could not be prevented eventually.</seg>
<seg id="8"> similarly, in the dover strait illegal immigrant incident a few years ago, the british police officer who first opened the container allegedly was scared senseless at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="9"> british authorities later put him through psychological conditioning for more than two months before they returned him to normal.</seg>
<seg id="10"> people suffer from immense psychological damage after experiencing disastrous stimulus. during this time, it is very difficult to completely recover by relying on personal strength alone. psychological scar will always be left behind.</seg>
<seg id="11"> since outsiders can hardly notice this type of scar, and even if it is discovered, they still cannot do anything either. many people involved will feel painful for their entire life as a result.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, in our country, people do not show enough concern for psychological damage. especially families or administrative departments of the people involved, more often than not, they will abruptly think of it only after the best recovery period has passed, but it is already too late then.</seg>
<seg id="13"> nowadays, with the diversification of the media, we learn about some appalling incidents all the time. many female youth were harmed and many young children witnessed their parents suffered from cruel injuries.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after these youth were rescued, we seldom heard that they had received psychological treatment. more of them were offered familiar comfort by relatives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> even though the victims can feel that they are already safe, the damage they experienced has become an incurable scar that will always be awaken and affects the life of the people involved.</seg>
<seg id="16"> fortunately, the leader of the driver offered him consolation immediately, which could relieve his psychological pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17"> after all, the driver was not responsible for the accident. in addition, the driver had also adopted measures when he found out the situation. he had done what he should do; only that he did not stop the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i believe that even if it were not the driver involved, anyone present would be shocked by the accident that happened at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="19"> nonetheless, other people are not connected to the person who committed suicide in regards to responsibility. despite being shocked, it will gradually fade from their memories with the passing of time.</seg>
<seg id="20"> the driver involved is not as fortunate. he must remember and probably will remember it for a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="21"> we can consider him fortunate if he can liberate himself from this. if he cannot free himself from it, he will always be tortured by such shock.</seg>
<seg id="22"> modern health concepts are much more comprehensive than those in the past. people began to show concern for mental health.</seg>
<seg id="23"> regrettably, the mental state of human beings is very depressing. particularly in the cities, the mental health of people is very unsatisfactory. majority of people suffer more or less from hidden psychological dangers. yet, some people still have not raised enough concern when they encounter problems.</seg>
<seg id="24"> think about the lesson learned from the "yang lijuan incident" that happened a while ago. some irresponsible media outlets used a patient tormented by mental problems as target of media hype, thus causing serious social impacts.</seg>
<seg id="25"> we should avoid this type of incident from happening in the future. otherwise, our society will truly become a diseased society.</seg>

<seg id="6"> she likes the male anchor of a popular entertainment show in taiwan and never conceals this type of feeling.</seg>

<seg id="8"> in the book that the male anchor wrote, he said that a friend presented him with a slingshot with no bullet. she told me with a pleasant surprise, "i presented him with that slingshot."</seg>
<seg id="9"> she also participates in creating an electronic magazine for this star. she reads every issue with me with excitement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i have always quite enjoyed befriending people who are open about being fans of so-and-so stars themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11"> these stars can be movie and television stars. they can be star players. of course, they can also be great men.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i never consider these friends shallow. i think they are very likable.</seg>
<seg id="13"> these people are people with true temperament in general. their likes and dislikes are real.</seg>
<seg id="14"> it is very relaxing to mix with this type of people.</seg>
<seg id="15"> even though they will not consider your feelings 100 percent, at least you know all their emotions. you also know that you will have bigger sense of security when fraternizing with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> these people are also very honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> one should realize that it requires courage to express one's likes.</seg>
<seg id="18"> precisely due to this reason, many people will like a person but not letting it known for their entire life. in addition, they may even quite despise people who brazenly claim to be fans of so-and-so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i believe honesty is the biggest strength of a person. be honest with one's friends and oneself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> however, it is indeed very difficult to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="21"> it also proves that one has selflessness in one's heart if one is able to like a star.</seg>
<seg id="22"> my friends are all fans of some stars.</seg>
<seg id="23"> sometimes, in order to get a glimpse of the stars, they can endure hardships, sacrifice a lot, live frugally, hold cardboard with their left hand and press the camera with their right with their mouth yelling at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="24"> we can say that they are very simpleminded and na茂ve. however, it requires selflessness to love a person without giving any thought to reciprocation.</seg>
<seg id="25"> it is because in reality, there is too much self-admiration and self-righteousness for oneself and disapproval of others. therefore, this selflessness seems somewhat precious.</seg>
<seg id="26"> thus, if all of us are chatting and we say that the stars we like are so-and-so, if one of us says, "i never adore other people",</seg>
<seg id="27"> haha, then we have to be careful.</seg>

<seg id="1"> zhang xiaohui that person</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key word: zhang xiaohui</seg>
<seg id="3"> i saw an episode of kangxi arrives that i had not seen for ages by chance. the lead was zhang xiaohui.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i remember it was the time when she was advertising for color blossoms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the time i watched color blossoms was the days when i was obsessed with erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> at that time, i felt very odd because pornographic movies could actually be shot so aesthetically. sometimes they were also very interesting by being called erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in fact, i have not watched too many erotic movies but they have covered many countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the ones i first came into contact were from korea and japan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i later watched quite a bit from third world countries, latin america, and europe but less from hollywood and france instead.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i was unwilling to delete two of them from my computer. one was youth and the other was color blossoms.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the first half of color blossoms was still quite good. everyone was rookie and all put forth efforts in their performances. the director also had high standard.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, the latter half was somewhat perverted. i could not take it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> actually, what i want to say is that in the program, zhang xiaohui said that her boyfriends almost cover every country in the world except africa.</seg>
<seg id="14"> she currently has four boyfriends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i am afraid people in general cannot accept this matter. they will say that this person is promiscuous.</seg>
<seg id="16"> however, the crux of the matter is that she was very honest and showed no expression that made people uncomfortable when she talked about these issues.</seg>
<seg id="17"> she also discussed her own view of love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> for instance, the two parties should be financially independent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i assume it also requires independent personality and being able to control one's own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="20"> it is because i know that love is alive and selfish for people who are in love. how would someone allow the person he loves to accept other people's love at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="21"> based on my experience and conjecture, most probably, the love of zhang xiaohui is no longer tender and romantic. she must be the typical sister-brother-love.</seg>
<seg id="22"> in sister-brother-love, the older sister can tolerate everything including having several little brothers at the same time. meanwhile, the little brother can bear boundless attachment to the older sister because of the other party's charm and maternal instinct. however, he may not mind whether he is the only one, so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="23"> nevertheless, from the conversation of zhang xiaohui, i also found that she is indeed someone who knows how to enjoy life very well.</seg>
<seg id="24"> for example, she loves traveling to the extent of excessively extravagant.</seg>
<seg id="25"> thus, i also have reason to believe that her life is also very wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="26"> if it were before, i am afraid i still could not accept this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27"> it is just like i have also accepted many people now. in fact, it has little to do with being tolerant or not. it depends on once i straighten it out; there is no absolute love or no love.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these people are, for instance, passer-by a, friend b, zhang ziyi, good friend d, and also furongjiejie.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when we look at other people's life, we are spectators. for other people, how can we not be the main characters of our lives as well?</seg>
<seg id="30"> this is as if despite my absence in the world, legends of me exist in it all along.</seg>

<seg id="1"> people ought to have a little play spirit</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key word: play spirit</seg>
<seg id="3"> it is a very tiring matter for people to live. therefore, they should have a little play spirit.</seg>
<seg id="4"> one should either laugh at oneself, or read other people's jokes and gossip about other people.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for example, one can relax a little at the "entertainment gossip" page at tianya.</seg>
<seg id="6"> people speak their mind there but of course, you should have the ability to know right from wrong because there are all kinds of nonstop "evils".</seg>
<seg id="7"> the result of "say what you please" is that you do not know what you have said either. however, you need to understand what you read.</seg>
<seg id="8"> xiao s called cai kangyong a "scholar".</seg>
<seg id="9"> if i am also qualified, then i belong to the type who have studied a bit but have not had a thorough grasp yet.</seg>
<seg id="10"> fortunately, i always know my limitations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> however, i may as well get what i want while i do this bit of studying.</seg>
<seg id="12"> it so happens that i like to take wild guesses as well. as a result, i think while i read. yet, i have straightened out many reasons and have suddenly seen the light in many matters.</seg>
<seg id="13"> thus, i gradually form some habits, for instance, i tell myself to be a little tougher on myself and be a little nicer to other people;</seg>
<seg id="14"> when problem arises, first look to myself for a reason;</seg>
<seg id="15"> be more rational when handling matters and more emotional when treating friendship;</seg>
<seg id="16"> and to conduct myself in a low-key attitude, and handle matters in a low-key attitude as well.</seg>
<seg id="17"> however, you know that no one is that good. people will always be selfish, always consider their success and failure, and always in an emotional mess when they should be rational but extremely goddamn rational while they need to be emotional.</seg>
<seg id="18"> yet, the good thing is that i never think of regret when i deal with choices that i made.</seg>
<seg id="19"> it has been done and i accept the setback.</seg>
<seg id="20"> why do people have to think about so many useless things?</seg>
<seg id="21"> fortunately, i am not the type of people who like to wear a stern look to raise my scholarly status either. i am also a philistine after all.</seg>
<seg id="22"> the only difference between me and other people is that i do not have to be cynical. i am more rational in everything.</seg>
<seg id="23"> alternatively, for instance, i have particularly strong faith.</seg>
<seg id="24"> once i trust a person, then i believe that everything about him is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> even if he has shortcomings, i will still willingly tolerate them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> even though i am not the type who gather friends around, i am the kind who put myself in their shoes and consider their interests.</seg>
<seg id="27"> however, due to this reason, i am rather strict with screening friends as well.</seg>
<seg id="28"> it is also quite beyond my understanding why so many people still have so much trust in what is said and done in the newspapers nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="29"> or perhaps in their mind, news stories nowadays still have the type of sacredness that they had before.</seg>
<seg id="30"> however, there are still many things in this world that i do not comprehend.</seg>
<seg id="31"> joke.</seg>
<seg id="32"> slap myself in the face.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: song dandan, the depths of happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> a while ago, i learned from the newspaper that song dandan had published a new book titled the depths of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i wanted to read it very much.</seg>
<seg id="5"> it was because i wanted to see how a woman at her age with such a profession sees herself and life after experiencing changes in family and career.</seg>
<seg id="6"> it was not disappointing as expected. i had two thoughts after reading it: first, i was electrified. one can also see one's shadow when watching the life of others. second, i was greatly touched all the same. they were all details of emotional ties with family and the like.</seg>
<seg id="7"> why was i electrified?</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the book, song dandan wrote, "i have neglected a very important principle in life: giving is happier than receiving.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i am always busy with giving, busy with making myself happy.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i am incapable of and know little about receiving. i have neglected to let other people give, that is, i have neglected the right +of other people to get happiness."</seg>
<seg id="11"> i discovered that i have always enjoyed this type of happiness as well. perhaps i should pay more attention to it in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12"> it requires considerable courage for a person to calmly face her past and display all these in front of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="13"> included in here were her first love, her failed marriage with yingda, a deep self-examination, and the emotional tie to her son.</seg>
<seg id="14"> there is also one more thing worth praising about this book. it is because being a publisher, it would definitely do its utmost to urge her to stress on things including i love my home, house of flying daggers, and a series of short plays with zhao benshan at the outset.</seg>
<seg id="15"> however, i believe that she must have insisted. she only mentioned a little about zhao benshan in the end. as for house of flying daggers and i love my home, she hardly mentioned them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> +the entire book was full of the realization toward life, love, family, and emotional ties with family of a 40-year-old woman. it was warm and moving.</seg>

<seg id="1"> busy holiday</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: holiday, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> it has almost been a week into my holiday. i have not been idle either.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i attended a meeting at the college. in addition, i have to prepare the materials for next week's meeting and the speech for the conference.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i will be very busy during this holiday.</seg>
<seg id="6"> if nothing unexpected happens, according to plan, i have three meetings to attend and four to five cities to visit.</seg>
<seg id="7"> my life is suddenly filled with many same and different varieties of contents. i almost forget how i spent the holidays before.</seg>
<seg id="8"> it seems that i have never been idle either as far as i can remember.</seg>
<seg id="9"> only that i originally had a long period of time for me to allocate at one point. yet, the time seems less this year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> is it good or bad?</seg>
<seg id="11"> it will be more substantial when one is busy. however, if there is no result or gains for being busy, then its significance will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, sometimes it seems that we cannot consider life completely based on results. life is for us to slowly experience. steadiness, peace, fullness, and happiness is also a kind of gains, even though this type of gains sometimes cannot be measured by standard of social judgment.</seg>
<seg id="13"> everyone needs to have firm belief in social value and personal value. what will we do if the two cannot coexist?</seg>
<seg id="14"> marxism teaches us to put our priority on social value. it advocates individual to contribute to society. however, in reality, a healthy and sound society should also fully respect the wish and choice of value of individuals and create conditions for the realization of individual value.</seg>
<seg id="15"> these suddenly came to my mind. i found out more and more that marxist principles are indeed very effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> yes, this is indeed what the theory says. however, when it comes to reality, people cannot help but still feel perplexed sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="17"> even when the realization of individual value does not interfere with social value, will any of us realistic individual be satisfied with the realization of our true self and +ignore social judgment?</seg>
<seg id="18"> or, can our satisfaction derived from individual value break away from social judgment?</seg>
<seg id="19"> it seems very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20"> therefore, while all of us try our best to be ordinary average people, we cannot help but to pursue extraordinariness and transcendence at the same time. yet, we will always blame ourselves if we waste our lives.</seg>
<seg id="21"> this probably is the social aspect of people.</seg>
<seg id="22"> i am still somewhat more relaxed now that i am on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="23"> at least i have time to watch vcds and play for a while with ease.</seg>
<seg id="24"> for what is worth, work still needs to be done and life will still be lived as before.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i need to go to xi'an for a meeting again next week.</seg>
<seg id="26"> a city that i have never visited but due to some "preconceptions", i seem not to like it very much.</seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope this trip can change my impression of the city. haha.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "live a very feminist life"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: male, women's right, era</seg>
<seg id="3"> ying called me on the phone in the afternoon. we chatted for a while and we talked about me watching "happy male voice".</seg>
<seg id="4"> ying said, "no kidding? you are so cute. you watched super female voice and then happy male voice. you are simply loyal viewer of hunan satellite tv."</seg>
<seg id="5"> i said, "that's true."</seg>
<seg id="6"> ying said that she had watched some talent selection shows of male contestants. she felt that all of them were feminine men. i felt the same. however, i told her that happy male voice had entered the round of five. next week will be the round of four. the contestants can sing really well and are all neck and neck.</seg>
<seg id="7"> ying, who studies mass culture and consumer culture, also said excitedly that she has to watch it next week as well. after all, the competition has reached the most crucial phase so it must be well worth watching. she can also accumulate some case resources for future study if she follows these things.</seg>
<seg id="8"> we then said that this is an era of male charm.</seg>
<seg id="9"> men finally turn from "viewers" into "being viewed" while women, who were the objects in the past, have become the subjects. they can admire and face all kinds of men shows of this era of male charm from the angle of an observer.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ying said that it is female liberation. it is a sign of feminism.</seg>
<seg id="11"> she then went on to say, "don't you feel that you are living a very feminist life now?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> i was so happy after i heard ying's words that i laughed heartily.</seg>
<seg id="13"> this statement itself was full of feminist implication, only that i do not have ying's good analysis ability to expound these things in a more profound and clear way.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i like the singing of chen chusheng in happy male voice very much. it has a very special sense of reality, a power that touches people's heart and penetrates through space and time. it is very pure and comfortable;</seg>
<seg id="15"> the songs of su xing are of a wide variety. he put great expression in his performance. he has fine and gentle facial features but gives people a relaxed and lively feeling;</seg>
<seg id="16"> the singing of zhang jie is very resonant and powerful, especially the two songs titled your look and the past has gone with the wind that he sang in the competition today were both old songs that i like very much. they have left me with a deep impression;</seg>
<seg id="17"> wei chen has a cute and innocent face similar to lu yi. allegedly, girls find it very likable. of course, he also has good voice.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the further competition of such final four should be very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i look forward to watching their wonderful performances next week!</seg>

<seg id="1"> utterly confused kimchi mood of 6/29</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key words: kimchi, seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> utterly confused kimchi mood of 6/29  i turned on international roaming. however, once i disembarked the plane, it seemed that the battery of my mobile phone had died. there was still not a single signal bar. perhaps the turf of global communications means the sphere of the heart. moreover, it will be effective from the next billing date.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i will lose contact with other people temporarily in these few days. oh, oh, will anyone worry about me because of this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> i turned on secretarial paging just to prove who is thinking of me.</seg>
<seg id="6"> whether it is business or personal.</seg>
<seg id="7"> however, the question is, then again, whose longing do i hope it will be?</seg>
<seg id="8"> i do not know when my heart started to turn blank again.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i cannot understand why i always fail to keep the people whom i want to keep from leaving. yet, some people whom i do not want to keep, they always assume that they can squeeze inside. does it sound like i am talking about how i feel about marketplace?</seg>
<seg id="10"> however, the heart cannot be stuffed by "white gloves" whether there is a place for you or not, can it?</seg>
<seg id="11"> after all, material and heart still cannot be mentioned in the same breath!</seg>
<seg id="12"> our car travels on the highway to busan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the department head drives without saying a word. i have nothing to make conversation with either.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after all, he neither speaks chinese nor english. as for me, i also only know a few, a few broken english sentences.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i look at the computer and strike the keyboard rather boringly. inside the car, besides the sound of the keyboard, there is the cheerful gprs navigation sound of the korean woman. everything is somewhat too quiet.</seg>
<seg id="16"> only the endless green and the grayish blue sky is left to be seen outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="17"> it is rather unlike my personality to be quiet.</seg>
<seg id="18"> to my surprise, the only thing in this country that gives me a warm feeling actually turns out to be english.</seg>
<seg id="19"> the circles that come into view besides creating an effect of radioactive dizziness on me, they have no other function at all.</seg>
<seg id="20"> i believe that south korea will never produce compasses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> it is because the market has no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="22"> seoul was very clean, thoroughly clean, scrupulously clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> however, unfortunately, the few days that i stayed in seoul, other than work place and department stores, i did not have time to go anywhere. all my impressions were limited to looking around along the way.</seg>
<seg id="24"> fortunately, everything was still good!</seg>
<seg id="25"> south koreans are polite in accordance with their tradition. they smile scrupulously and methodically, listen carefully, and are elegant and calm.</seg>
<seg id="26"> all that i can notice are glorious appearances, traditional customs, ancient structures, and overly modest civilization.</seg>
<seg id="27"> is this hypocritical?</seg>
<seg id="28"> it might be better to be hypocritical. at least everyone is courteous!</seg>
<seg id="29"> one may think that hideous things do not exist if they cannot be seen.</seg>
<seg id="30"> the food in south korea is excellent!</seg>
<seg id="31"> only that i dislike and cannot understand why they spend so much repeated efforts only to make kimchi into assorted hors d'oeuvres with all kinds of things. of course, there has to be seaweed.</seg>
<seg id="32"> in second thought, south koreans still have a profound knowledge in food. they can differentiate between kimchi that is pickled above ground or underground and the duration of the pickling with high accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="33"> this indirectly signifies that the meticulousness of the south koreans may have something to do with having kimchi all the time.</seg>
<seg id="34"> however, i am worried how the japanese tofu restaurant that the department head is about to take us to will integrate kimchi into its cooking again.</seg>
<seg id="35"> when i thought about the chinese cuisine that we had last night, i felt like crying. it was entirely koreanized. the only thing that was palatable turned out to be kimchi.</seg>
<seg id="36"> oh, ah, thank you for the kimchi that the china southern airlines offered with the on flight meal.</seg>
<seg id="37"> the airlines company must have thought that i have to get used to it from the moment i get on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="38"> two more days and i will return to my country. if there is still no one to miss, then i may as well think of the pork braised in brown sauce that my aunt will make.</seg>
<seg id="39"> after all, satisfaction of the stomach is more direct than satisfaction of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> of course, it has nothing to do with kimchi.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> two trees, one was me and the other was my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> we were each other's shade and we took care of each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> people of my generation all have many sons and daughters. however, i only have older and younger sisters but no older or younger brother. as a result, the arrival of my brother-in-law sounded extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="5"> we were all born poor children. we had to take part in multifarious chores and physical labor since we were very young. even though i had tried my best to pretend to be a grown man all along and wanted to do the work as good as a connoisseur did, i never had the approval of my father.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i have had problem of sleepwalking ever since i was young but it is not too serious. however, i could not avoid losing concentration when i did my chores.</seg>
<seg id="7"> for instance, my father asked me to plaster the chimney of our old house. i climbed up the roof to operate quickly.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the chimney was plastered but when it rained, the house was +leaking because i had crushed the tiles of the roof.</seg>
<seg id="9"> here is another example. my father asked me to change the light bulb, the old-styled incandescent lamp type.</seg>
<seg id="10"> when i climbed up the chair, yet, the light bulb i was holding slipped out of my hand and fell to the cement floor, smashed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> examples like these are too many to be enumerated. therefore, after my brother-in-law was admitted to the family, the odds and ends small jobs were naturally undertaken by him and were done extremely well and effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> while for me, i gladly hid in the corner and read those leisure books that seemed like bricks.</seg>
<seg id="13"> we later grew into two trees, two tall trees that could support the veranda of the family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> as for father, he inevitably dwarfed. he, who sat on the wheelchair, became an obscure bush underneath the dense leafy shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> who would have expected that the situation suddenly changed. my 50-year-old brother-in-law suffered from serious illness all of a sudden. the tall tree that looked lush green and exuberant was actually, beyond belief, approaching the frightening death.</seg>
<seg id="16"> on that summer day with dazzling sunshine that made people dizzy, outside the operating room of the peking union medical college hospital, the doctor mentioned casually, "it is not worth operating anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17"> he can live for two more months at the most."</seg>
<seg id="18"> at that moment, i felt as if i was suddenly shot by a stray bullet. my soul left my body instantaneously. i was there panic-stricken like a fool.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i started to sleepwalk again. i saw our family's old courtyard and the young brother-in-law's busy figure in it.</seg>
<seg id="20"> it was my sister's sharp cry that woke me up. i rushed to hold my sister who fell onto the hospital's corridor. we, who were embracing each other, were all tears.</seg>
<seg id="21"> the dazzling sun suddenly disappeared. i suffered from blackout spells.</seg>
<seg id="22"> my brother-in-law soon learned about his illness after returning to our city from beijing. he was relieved instead after he and older sister cried in each other's arms.</seg>
<seg id="23"> my brother-in-law started to arrange for his funeral methodically. for instance, he told his son, "take good care of your paternal grandmother for me. after the venerable elder passed away, she has to be buried with your paternal grandfather. this is how the grave should be uncovered during burial.</seg>
<seg id="24"> visit your maternal grandfather often. buy him some practical items during chinese new year."</seg>
<seg id="25"> for instance, he told my younger sister, "after i pass away, you need to visit your older sister often. she will be very lonely for sure all by herself."</seg>
<seg id="26"> i found as much time as possible to visit him. however, when he faced me, he looked very ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="27"> words failed ourselves all the time. we were like two plants that despite having life, could not converse.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these were two grown trees. the tempering by trials and hardships had made us capable of facing adversities calmly. was it still necessary for him to brief me on anything?</seg>
<seg id="29"> it seemed unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="30"> it was because you knew in your heart: after you passed away, my older sister, the children you had with my older sister, and this big family could only rely on me, this tree alone, to support them.</seg>
<seg id="31"> who asked me to be born a man?</seg>
<seg id="32"> as a man, you have to straighten your back and shoulder responsibilities without hesitation whether you want to do it or not.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the only regret was: why did your tree wither that early? you should have a rich and verdant old age.</seg>
<seg id="34"> you passed away on the first day of the new year.</seg>
<seg id="35"> you left by yourself in loneliness when chinese all over the world welcomed the new spring with great joy.</seg>
<seg id="36"> perhaps, there is another young shoot of life emerging in another space and time?</seg>

<seg id="2"> the reason i have such seemingly trendy title was that at that grim despair moment, the confused brain was simply too busy to consider time.</seg>
<seg id="3"> it was as if an innocent person received a ruling of death sentence for no reason. would he still nit-pick on the grammatical errors in the arbitral award in a calm and leisurely manner?</seg>
<seg id="4"> it was a day in the winter. the youth settlement was very cold.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i was not sure who was on duty either. the furnace had had no fire all day.</seg>
<seg id="6"> since it was said that there would be strong earthquake, we did not bother to make a fire when we went back to our place in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on the big wide bed that sleeps 12 people, the four of us wrapped ourselves in cotton-wadded quilts. under the dim light, we played poker "three on one" for meal coupon, quivering with cold.</seg>
<seg id="8"> suddenly, crushing rolls of noise traveled +from afar to near. the few of us looked at each other only for an instant. we immediately realized the arrival of disaster.</seg>
<seg id="9"> we thus flung off the cards in our hands and leapt swiftly onto the floor. we passed through two narrow doors and piled out.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the instant we ran out of the dormitory, the poor stone hut was grounded to dust in a twinkling.</seg>
<seg id="11"> we, who rushed to the courtyard, were like standing on a rocking boat. we swayed back and forth like tumblers and were unable to steady ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="12"> within these few seconds, the structures around us +resolutely gave up their prudent image in the past. they emitted strange "creaking and babbling" cries and danced an almost crazy break dance one after another. after that, they committed suicide by turning into a strand of smoke and dust.</seg>
<seg id="13"> naturally, the power lines above us were unwilling to be left out of the limelight. they broke suddenly with a "snap" and scattered in all directions just like whips.</seg>
<seg id="14"> meanwhile, the evil earthquake that wrecked havoc was setting off celebratory fireworks for its creativity all around us. the multicolored earthquake lightning could rival the stage art effects of any blockbuster war movies. the rumbling earthquake noise sounded like battle drum that boosted the morale, torturing every weak nerve.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i only had one thought at that time: the end of human beings has arrived!</seg>
<seg id="16"> i could imagine: the ground underfoot opens with a loud crash while boiling lava sends out blazing invitation as if it were steel. people drop into the lava one after another in free fall like nonentities. they are so stingy that they do not even have a trace of light smoke before they disappear in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="17"> my spine had the wonderful numbness of being filled with ice water. in the gloom, the faces of the few companions were uncertain as if they were paper masks.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i thought: do human beings bid farewell to this colorful world just like this? will tens of thousands of years of history of civilization disappear from then on?</seg>
<seg id="19"> however, i am not even 20 years old. my flower of youth has just bloomed and i just felt the delight in being alive. i am so reluctant to leave my wonderful life!</seg>
<seg id="20"> my parents and my relatives, where are you all? what are you all doing at this moment? are you still alive in this world?</seg>
<seg id="21"> at this moment when i face the repugnant smile of death, i miss you all so much!</seg>
<seg id="22"> ......i was not sure how much time had past. the muddle-headed me finally found out gladly: the earthquake sound was gradually weakening. the trembling of the earth was slowing down bit by bit while the fireworks above me no longer twinkled.</seg>
<seg id="23"> a huge vessel that had been heaving in the stormy sea finally entered a peaceful harbor slowly.</seg>
<seg id="24"> a young heart that was easily broken was eventually put back to its original place carefully after experiencing near insane atrocities.</seg>
<seg id="25"> earth, my home, you finally allowed us to feel the warmth and affection of a home again!</seg>
<seg id="26"> a warm feeling of surviving a disaster slowly filled the entire body from underfoot like a warm current.</seg>
<seg id="27"> after getting a firm footing, yu doudou, who just turned 17 years old, suddenly wailed in the face of the desolate scene of the ruins of the courtyard of the youth settlement that was once harmonious and warm.</seg>
<seg id="28"> all the people were infected and hot tears gushed down our faces.</seg>
<seg id="29"> it started to snow. was it mourning that fluttered for the misfortune of human beings?</seg>
<seg id="30"> that year, the earthquake in haicheng killed 1,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31"> expert said, "fortunately, the forecast was in time. in addition, it happened before people went to bed. otherwise, a major earthquake at a magnitude of '7.3' would have at least seized 100,000 lives!</seg>
<seg id="32"> only a year later, the tangshan earthquake that killed over 200,000 people happened.</seg>

<seg id="1"> matters of the village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> there are many families in the village. among which, the family called nan is the most annoying. there is a famous saying that is very popular in the village: guard against fire, guard against theft, and guard against nan.</seg>
<seg id="3"> in fact, the nan family is still quite honest.</seg>
<seg id="4"> some others will usually steal a melon or something from other peoples' fields while the nan family will steal a chicken or a dog at the most. it cannot be to the extent that the entire village is isolating the nan family.</seg>
<seg id="5"> no one is clean. whom did our nan family offend?</seg>
<seg id="6"> the nan family set about holding some honorable activities to make known that this village was first built by the ancestors of the nan family, that the nan family has always been a large family that grows food, that some famous people in history had also come from the family, and the family has made major contributions to the building of the village as well.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the same time, the nan family carefully invites the village cadres to look around and visit its home.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in short, the entire nan family works hard and wants to fight an active battle and better itself.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, the xi family did a very shameful thing by cruelly persecuting nan family's seedlings.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the family named xi made its name in the village by acting as a matchmaker. young men from the village all benefit from the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="11"> if not for the good matchmaking that xi family did, how could you families do well in your production!</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, this time, the xi family actually smashed nan family's seedlings with black bricks at a place called hongdong. it was indeed completely abominable. the entire village felt resentful and they all said that none of the people in the xi family is good.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the nan family went to the xi family to demand an explanation. it had gained the sympathy of the entire village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the entire village all spitted at the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="15"> as a result, the battlefield was moved to the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="16"> the nan family determined to build a nice image before the 17th village meeting to make the nan family, the largest growing family, flourish.</seg>
<seg id="17"> even though the village cadres urge people to get along harmoniously everyday, this village named zhong is never peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the most disgusting thing is that in merely two to three months, even the pigs started to clamor and revolt in a hubbub and demand a higher status!</seg>
<seg id="19"> two years ago, the chickens in all the villages suffered from a flu and they were all killed, weren't they?</seg>
<seg id="20"> pigs, why don't you be smart?</seg>
<seg id="21"> if you continue to create an uproar and try to revolt, you will be unavoidably killed!</seg>
<seg id="22"> yet, even though the mei village and the ying village that are used to treat people high-handedly live an abundant life, they are not necessarily peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="23"> isn't it scary enough that some tramps knocked down the tall buildings of the mei village today and are going to throw small explosive cans in the subway of the ying village tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id="24"> as a result, people of the zhong village generally believe that even though it is sickening that they cannot afford to live in a room, visit the doctor, and go to school, they can cultivate land, work part-time, and build connections without worries. it is also entering a new era, of a sort.</seg>
<seg id="25"> the nan family and the xi family, oh, which family does not have its share of troubles?</seg>
<seg id="26"> let's take the wan family who lives at a small bend southeast of the village as example. even though the parents of the family are somewhat shameless, our great zhong village still defends this family as usual, doesn't it?</seg>
<seg id="27"> seeing that the 2008 sports meet of all villages will be held in our zhong village, please save the troubles and straighten the bad children in the village.</seg>
<seg id="28"> all families, raise the lamps and make the fire. oh, those who have money give money, oh, those who have labor power give labor power.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when the time arrives, people will all go to the village public office to watch golden eggs laid into the nest!</seg>
<seg id="30"> (dubbing outside the picture, fading: golden eggs or silver eggs? fellow viewers, fellow viewers, i am yongge, anchor of cun television station......)</seg>

<seg id="5"> this reply of google ceo eric to reporters' queries at the google inc. second quarter 2007 earnings conference call held last week ( http://investor.google.com/earnings.html )showed that he was very satisfied with the current results that google china has achieved and that he was fully confident about the future development of google in the chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> eric said that we have outstanding talents in china, increasingly improved facilities, and a product line that continues to enrich its localization contents.</seg>
<seg id="7"> he believed that even though the success of google may not necessarily be at hand, it is an excellent start for google china. in addition, drawing on the hard work of the chinese team, the support of the headquarters, and unswerving spirit, he firmly believed that google will make amazing achievement in china in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8"> yes. the important thing is that we keep progressing upward staunchly because we grow up here. we have deep feelings for this place. we strongly believe that google should give china a lot more. it should give its users a lot more.</seg>

<seg id="4"> therefore, in such an age, the mules you wear under your feet may very possibly be outdated as well because a brand new type of strapless mules that only have a sole have appeared now.</seg>
<seg id="5"> how can one wear them if there is no strap?</seg>
<seg id="6"> we are not celestial beings and the manufacturer does not have magic either.</seg>
<seg id="7"> this type of mules is directly...glued to the bottom of your feet. this is not a product of prank but actual merchandize. the sale price is approximately us $13.5/pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this is yet another product that "i have imagined that it exists but do not expect that it actually does". it makes people speechless.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the manufacturer believes that this type of mules is very cool. you do not believe it, do you?</seg>

<seg id="3"> iljin display, a korean-based company, had introduced a laser projector module that is only as small as a coin.</seg>
<seg id="4"> since the size of the module is extremely small, it can even be built into a mobile phone and a 7-inch projection area can be seen on the wall.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) the traditional projector consists of three different lcd panels responsible for the output of the three different video signals of red, green, and blue. meanwhile, this mini projector can convert among the three colors by using a single lcd panel alone, thus reducing the volume and production cost of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> an official statement claimed that the lcd panel of this type of projector itself is only 0.24 inches and can be easily integrated into a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> currently, more than half of the mobile phones on the market have cameras built into them. i reckon mobile phones with built-in projector will appear on the market very soon. however, it is really hard to say whether the prospect of the market will be good or not.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> recently someone posed a question: are there any mao loyalists among 30-year-olds?</seg>
<seg id="3"> later, the age was changed to 20.</seg>
<seg id="4"> actually, the people of this age group never experienced the mao zedong era.  i +wonder if the one who posed this question suffers from a brain malfunction, or a congenital brain defect.</seg>
<seg id="5"> in cities, the most qualified voices about the mao zedong era should be those who personally experienced that time, those who suffered much during +that time, that is, those who were born during the period from 1950-1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> after they were born, their parents participated in political activities and were unable to provide equivalent love to their children.</seg>
<seg id="7"> just when they needed nourishment, there was a three-year natural disaster, with much suffering from hunger.</seg>
<seg id="8"> as they began school, they ran into the cultural revolution, wasting several years of study.</seg>
<seg id="9"> some even quit school for good.  from 15-17 years of age, without having finished school, they were forced to give up school and respond to the party's call to go up into the mountains and down into the villages, to support frontier areas.</seg>
<seg id="10"> after they went to work, they regarded the working class as the most honorable, voluntarily choosing the dirtiest and most tiring work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> glory for a time, worthless for life.</seg>
<seg id="12"> when it was time to get married, it was from them that late marriage, late childbirth, and only one child started.</seg>
<seg id="13"> +when it should have been time for a pay +raise, enterprises required diplomas.  they couldn't get pay +raises without a diploma.</seg>
<seg id="14"> they worked laboriously to raise their children, supporting them through basic education.   when their children were admitted to universities, they ran into the double whammy of education system reform and state-owned enterprise reform, facing tuition increases and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="15"> growing older day by day, they started getting sick, and were sadly caught up in medical system reform.  unable to afford medical fees, their illnesses were denied medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="16"> as can be seen, all of society's unfairness unsparingly befell this generation of theirs.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but among these people, few oppose mao zedong, attack mao zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> they were not mao zedong's minions.  they had flesh and blood, with their actual lives within the realm of human relations in our society.  they personally experienced the history of going up into the mountains and down to the villages, to unemployment, confronting the social phenomena of both eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> though they were greatly discontented with, even harboring hatred toward wasted education, hunger, cold, and some negative social phenomena of the mao zedong era, yet: in the view of national spirit, the morality of human relations, and the temperament of society, they still regard the mao zedong era as a good one.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "injected watermelons," "cancer-causing bananas," and "cardboard-filled buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [by wasteland beyond the great wall] posted at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send text message] [tabular menu] i remember in the year before last, it was reported that some people had used syringes to inject chemicals into hainan watermelons.  as a result, a large batch of watermelons rotted in the field in hainan, and large numbers of watermelon peasants lost money.</seg>
<seg id="3"> cctv later did a follow-up report.  it turned out this incident had never happened at all.</seg>
<seg id="4"> this news report sounded weird from the beginning because using syringes to inject chemicals into individual big watermelons not only lacked practical sense, but also was impossible to do in terms of the workload.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i can recall an even more vivid memory from last year.  certain news media reported that banana trees in hainan were infected with a disease similar to human cancer, and that infected banana trees were going to die for sure.</seg>
<seg id="6"> as a result, many people mistakenly thought that you could catch cancer by eating bananas.  the result was the same, the price of hainan bananas dropped sharply, causing banana farmers to be beyond grief, to pour out endless grievances.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the two above mentioned news reports both caused a sensational effect, in that they directly touched the most sensitive of people's nerves, that is, food safety issues.</seg>
<seg id="8"> if the news media claims that certain food threatens people's health, then the news is certain to travel quickly.  as for the subjects involved, people's general attitude is: better to be safe than sorry.  for an individual, it's no big deal to eat fewer hainan watermelons and bananas, but for producers and sellers of those products, the impact is way too much.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, shocking news concerning food safety exploded again in beijing: due to a rise in pork prices, people astonishingly used processed cardboard as filling for buns.  this was known as cardboard-filled buns.</seg>
<seg id="10"> on hearing the news, i was shocked too.  i felt these peddlers were too wily, going so far as to come up with a trick like this.  furthermore, i spread this news far and wide, advising my family and friends never to buy buns on the street again.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but yesterday there was suddenly news that the report on cardboard-filled buns was a piece of fake news, that the whole story was fabricated by one person.  while feeling relieved, i also wondered what has gone wrong in today's news media.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the real truth is, as i learned from a reliable source, zi, a temporary member of the program transparency on beijing tv's life channel, brought meat stuffing, flour, and cardboard bought from the market, and suggested that wei and others mix cardboard soaked in water into meat stuffing and make buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> zi used a household dv camera he brought along to shoot the preparation process, followed by editing, then used deception to have the program broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14"> currently the public security agency has lawfully taken the criminal suspect zi into criminal detention, and will deal with him sternly according to the law.</seg>
<seg id="15"> after the bun incident took place, the government quickly organized relevant departments to carry out investigations, and launched complete and thorough inspections of breakfast markets in beijing, to ensure the safety of common people's meals.</seg>
<seg id="16"> after the incident was confirmed, beijing tv openly apologized to the public, that it had learned a profound lesson, that it seriously investigated and dealt with the relevant persons responsible, and that it will further strengthen management, shore up weaknesses, and resolutely put an end to false news reports.</seg>
<seg id="17"> it's just that, although the cardboard-filled buns turned out to be imaginary, it is still uncertain when everyone will dare relax and buy buns from street stalls.</seg>
<seg id="18"> from one perspective, this incident also reflected the importance attached to food safety issues by the government, and its rapidity of action.  and to a certain extent, it showed that common beijing people's meals are relatively safe.  though it turned out to be a false alarm, the bun incident served as a reminder to everyone!</seg>

<seg id="1"> toward whom should education be responsible?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> recently i listened to a friend back home talk about some news regarding a school, and couldn't refrain from expressing my personal feelings.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the incident happened at southwest weiyu middle school, a private secondary school in shanghai municipality.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the school decided to arrange its best teachers for three classes at the school which had directly entered high school from middle school through contract.  meanwhile, several young teachers with no experience teaching third year high school students and with poor teaching records were assigned to teach classes admitted from outside schools through examination, or from the same school without signing the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the reason was that the contract students agreed to give up applying to other high schools at that time, so according to the agreement, the school must ensure best teachers for them.</seg>
<seg id="6"> yet for students of other classes, the school's position was: give young teachers a training opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="7"> i couldn't help but sigh with emotion.  toward whom should education be responsible?</seg>
<seg id="8"> i remember many years ago, when i was attending a key senior high school, with dissatisfaction about the teaching level of a math teacher, the whole class presumptuously signed their names requesting that the school replace the teacher.</seg>
<seg id="9"> later on, the school indeed replaced the teacher for us, since the school had promised us to treat all students equally, to be responsible toward all students.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ten years ago i came to america to pursue graduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="11"> one summer, when selecting courses for the coming semester, i found most of the elective courses offered in the department were strong in theory, while none of the few courses strong in functionality were offered.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i approached the dean to talk about it, telling him i thought there was a problem with the curriculum design.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the dean acknowledged that functional courses were not offered because there were not enough teachers.  after one or two years, these courses would be offered when teachers were available.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i remember telling him then, "this is your problem, not mine.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i came thousands of miles away from shanghai to study in your school because i was attracted by the introduction of your courses.</seg>
<seg id="16"> if you aren't able to offer these courses, you shouldn't put them in the introduction.  otherwise this is false advertising, irresponsible toward me and my family."</seg>
<seg id="17"> after listening to what i said, the dean pondered for a moment and said: let me see what i can do.</seg>
<seg id="18"> maybe it was too late, since all the courses were already arranged for online registration.</seg>
<seg id="19"> three weeks later, the dean approached me to have a talk.  he told me that his job was be responsible toward every student, including me, something to that effect.</seg>
<seg id="20"> he heard my suggestions and tried his best, adding two elective courses strong in functionality, hoping i would understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> after this happened, i took several courses taught by the dean.</seg>
<seg id="22"> he never held anything against me for having expressed my opinions to him.  for each of the courses, he justly gave me an a.</seg>
<seg id="23"> on the eve of graduation, i heard his secretary say that he had tried his best for each student, but not all students were appreciative toward him.</seg>
<seg id="24"> at the graduation ceremony, while giving a speech as an honors student representative, i told the dean: each of us feels heartfelt gratitude for all he did for us, because he tried his best to be responsible toward each of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i felt i had made a correct life choice to attend school here.</seg>
<seg id="26"> at this moment, i saw faint tears in the dean's eyes ... i think that one day, if in china every educator and the entire educational system can take responsibility for each student, china will truly take off soon.</seg>

<seg id="1"> central ny men's 4s volleyball tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> last sunday we took part in the central ny men's 4s volleyball tournament.  the tournament lasted six and a half hours.  in the end, our team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this tournament was actually organized as a training tournament in preparation for the volleyball tournament of the empire state games summer athletic event in new york.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the coach divided up four participating men's teams from central new york (a high school team, a university team, a 35 and over team, and a 45 and over team), then regrouped them into teams of four players each, including a setter, to carry out the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the rules of the tournament were quite interesting.  only back row players could attack, and dropping was not allowed within the three-meter line.  only the setter could block, and there were no changes of position.</seg>
<seg id="6"> so it was basically testing the teams' power attack strength, as well as defense, judgment, and positioning.</seg>
<seg id="7"> our team had a 2 meters tall offside hitter, who during attacks held the strong point and high point.  he took care of more than 60% of the attacks and points gained during the competition.  a 1.85 meter tall setter had a number of one-man blocks.</seg>
<seg id="8"> a 1.9 meter tall middle hitter made a number of attack mistakes, since he was in a back row.</seg>
<seg id="9"> and me, a 1.75 meter tall left-side hitter, was mainly responsible for receiving opponents' cross smashes, and occasionally launching surprise attacks at a decent success rate.</seg>
<seg id="10"> altogether, there were seven teams.  first was a round robin competition.  after our team won a match, the referee repeatedly called foot faults when our right-side hitter attacked, greatly demoralizing our players.  utterly shattered, we lost three matches in succession.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but after losing the matches, everyone calmed down.  during these three matches, our teamwork stabilized, then we began a winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="12"> after the round robin, our team had won three and lost three, good for 6th place in the group standings.</seg>
<seg id="13"> then came the additional matches.  aside from the first place team, teams from 2nd to 7th place were randomly matched to play elimination games.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the mental state and strategy of our team was stable.  our weapon was power, and we led all the way to reach the semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> in the semifinal, our opponent was strong at attacking and weak at defending.  though it made my arms black and blue, whenever i successfully took a powerful spike, i was twice as delighted as when i succeeded in a spike myself.</seg>
<seg id="16"> without even knowing what the final score was, we won.</seg>
<seg id="17"> during the final, our opponent was balanced at defending and attacking.  we succeeded by destroying their attack with serves, and led all the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> at the end, when the score was 21:24, we had match point.  two successive serves by the opposing team bounced off my arms as i was trying to dig.  at 23:24, our team's offside hitter ran over and told me that it didn't matter, it was only two balls.</seg>
<seg id="19"> the next ball flew toward me again, and fortunately i took it well.  the setter passed the ball back over his head to the offside hitter, and a powerful spike finished the battle.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> regarding free individuals, scattered about, a lot has been said about morals.</seg>
<seg id="3"> i have nothing to repeat in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="4"> what i'd like to say now is about collectivity.</seg>
<seg id="5"> every now and then, we encounter occasions where collectivity is needed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> on these occasions, for a collective, certain morals are needed.</seg>
<seg id="7"> we can often find certain positive morals in those once successful collectives.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this is by no means accidental.</seg>
<seg id="9"> because for these undertakings or activities, it's necessary to overcome certain immediate difficulties, to hold together as one, to put aside those faith-based factors.  i believe that in addition, those good moral values are playing a role not to be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="10"> at the very least, a group of people all with very low moral values can hardly work together to achieve great things.  that's highly predictable.</seg>
<seg id="11"> to succeed, it might be an essential quality for a collective to have the wisdom of a rationally far-sighted view of long-term interests.</seg>
<seg id="12"> actually, collectives often use various methods to obtain an identity, such as logos, terminology, and beliefs, as well as moral values.</seg>

<seg id="1"> (an exploratory topic) in life up to now, how many times have you truly felt happy?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> my close friend from high school finally received a visa.  at the end of august, she can head off for graduate studies at a prestigious university on the west coast of america.</seg>
<seg id="3"> today, a few classmates got together.  i was really happy for her, that her wish was fulfilled at long last.</seg>
<seg id="4"> seeing her so happy, i was really very envious.</seg>
<seg id="5"> recalling so long ago, i was only that happy during the time when i was admitted to high school.  at that time it never occurred to me that i could be admitted to one of the top schools in the city.  then as anticipated, i went to college, worked, during that time i never again experienced such happiness.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i was admitted to college, though it was not the one i had earlier desired, so i could not be greatly delighted.</seg>
<seg id="7"> during college, i pinned my hopes on going up north after graduation, to join my sweetheart with whom i had been in love for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the gods did not give me good fortune, and one month before my graduation, he proposed breaking up.  all my past dreams went up in smoke.</seg>
<seg id="9"> afterward, that is, i returned up north to work.  to date, it has been almost two years since i started working.  i have earned enough money for a decent car, but i have never again experienced such happiness.</seg>
<seg id="10"> today i chatted with my close friend.  i have a great understanding of her happiness.  having cautiously and diligently prepared for a year, now she is finally able to go abroad, to start a new life.  that dream come true feeling is truly thrilling.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i have no plans to go on studying, and i dislike life in foreign countries, because i had worked abroad for half a year, and found life abroad unsuitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> seeing my close friend happy, i couldn't help thinking: what about my dreams?</seg>
<seg id="13"> what can make me feel that happy again?</seg>
<seg id="14"> maybe finding someone who really likes me, is willing to be with me for the rest of my life.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i think at that time, i would cry with excitement, just as my close friend told me that when she passed the embassy interview and obtained the visa, she couldn't help crying.  she was finally rewarded for a year's diligence and concern.</seg>
<seg id="16"> but what about me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> on the matter of feelings, time after time i've been cautious, working hard.  when can i also have my wishes fulfilled and cry for joy?</seg>
<seg id="18"> maybe i'm not worth anything.  i have never had to worry about my personal career, yet how about my emotions?</seg>
<seg id="19"> when will my emotions find a place to rest?</seg>
<seg id="20"> on this issue, i've been constantly feeling very sad.</seg>
<seg id="21"> brothers and sisters, how do you feel?</seg>

<seg id="1"> promoting southeast university school of architecture</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> hehe, also considered an introduction to the school of architecture for southeast university alumni.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the latest first-hand information plus my personal experiences.  replacement guaranteed if it is fake.</seg>
<seg id="4"> dean wang, secretary an, teacher li of the personnel section, and several other teachers from the teaching and research office for architectural technology and science attended for the report.  i talked for one hour, and then everyone talked for about one and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="5"> after the formal report ended, teacher zhang (assistant dean) dragged me aside and told me that we were going to have a closed door talk in the office at the back.</seg>
<seg id="6"> he was extremely kind and affable.  having closed the door, he told me that it was inappropriate to bring up certain subjects at a formal meeting.  he said that he sensed i was unsure about my future income, and then informed me of some particular circumstances concerning teacher incomes at the school of architecture to reassure me.</seg>
<seg id="7"> prior to the report, dean wang gave a brief introduction of the school of architecture, saying that in the field of architecture, there are only six key courses throughout the country, namely two at southeast university, two at tsinghua, one at tongji, and one at tianjin university.  there are no others besides these.</seg>
<seg id="8"> he said that in recent years, the state has attached special importance to energy conservation in architecture, eco-friendly architecture, and architectural technology and science.  southeast university is interested in attracting a teacher for these areas,</seg>
<seg id="9"> he said they received over 20 resumes applying for research work in this area, domestic, japanese, and american (it seems the one was from me).</seg>
<seg id="10"> the school of architecture is very serious about this, and has carefully examined these applicants.</seg>
<seg id="11"> compared with architecture schools at some other universities that i know, that of southeast university is indeed in the lead.  tongji should keep a step ahead of southeast university in urban planning, yet concerning the area of architectural design, it seems that southeast university could still be slightly ahead (something i hadn't previously expected).</seg>
<seg id="12"> dean wang said the school of architecture has extremely sufficient scientific research funds in the past two years, with its status as an institution in the state's 985 project for key engineering construction.</seg>
<seg id="13"> he told me that last year, southeast university's school of architecture was given one-off financial support of 10 million from superior units as construction funds, of which 3.5 million was used directly in purchasing books for the architecture school's specialized library. (hehe, this is something even i would like to praise a bit.  what a large move!)</seg>
<seg id="14"> the rest of the funds were almost all used to purchase equipment for experiments in my research area.</seg>
<seg id="15"> rumor has it that several academicians have some complaints.</seg>
<seg id="16"> hehe ... by the way, i feel the college seemingly got ripped off on some imported equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17"> one experiment system for measuring indoor air-tightness, which is widely used in america and could have been obtained for an estimated 500 us dollars, cost southeast university 50 thousand rmb in the end!!!</seg>
<seg id="18"> there are other things as well.  many colleges and departments of southeast university have now moved to the new campus at jiulong lake, but the school of architecture is determined to stay, saying it wants to provide students with a positive architectural atmosphere.  on the old campus there are some classical buildings you can look at, which the new campus does not have.</seg>
<seg id="19"> hehe ... it seems that because other departments have moved out, the school of architecture was able to get another building.</seg>
<seg id="20"> so, dean wang told me straightforwardly that later i can be given my own single office.</seg>
<seg id="21"> i am very embarrassed that when dean wang was talking about this, i wasn't interested at all.</seg>
<seg id="22"> later, teacher zhang dragged me aside and told me that this is quite difficult and that even some old professors do not have single offices because office space is in extremely short supply.</seg>
<seg id="23"> this made me very uneasy.  it seems that i still don't fully understate the state of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> in a word, i had a wonderful time at southeast university during this visit.  leaders and relevant teachers at the school of architecture of southeast university left a positive impression on me with their extremely professional dedication and enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="25"> may southeast university develop smoothly, and the school of architecture keep its lead!</seg>

<seg id="4"> after the congo visit, sun yanzi has followed world vision to africa's niger on a second occasion.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at the press conference yesterday, she frankly admitted that this was by far the most grueling journey ever.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the local weather was hot, drinking water was murky, and while visiting the market, she ran into the locals angrily throwing stones in protest, even riding on the camel resulted in cuts sustained from the camel seat.</seg>
<seg id="7"> an eventful journey along the way made her shouted aloud in her heart on several occasions: "i really want to go home!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> startled to see malnourished young children</seg>
<seg id="9"> with three consecutive years of joining world vision activities to care for poor children, sun yanzi professes to be an experienced spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="10"> she brought along 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 sets of flashlights and 500 candies to be shared with the local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> she said that based on much cumulative experiences, the small gifts are always never enough for use no matter how many were brought along.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in nigeria the most serious issue is that mothers have no idea at all in upbringing and young children have serious malnutrition problems.</seg>
<seg id="13"> during her eight-hour car ride from the capital of niger to tawa, a small town 500km away, sun yanzi experienced a sandstorm which was rarely seen locally.</seg>
<seg id="14"> winds blowing the sand, accompanied with rainwater, the colors changed throughout the whole sky.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the jeep she rode in was swaying even more with the wind.</seg>
<seg id="16"> thinking back of that time, sun yanzi disclosed with a lingering fear that although inside the vehicle, she was still very much afraid.</seg>
<seg id="17"> only when she later heard the local people explaining that sandstorm is a symbol of good luck, bringing rainwater to moisturize the earth did she feel slightly relieved.</seg>
<seg id="18"> together with the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="19"> saddened by mothers with upbringing problems</seg>
<seg id="20"> upon arriving at tawa, the local officials held a welcoming ceremony on a dromedary and invited sun yanzi to sit on the camel to receive the acclamation of the locals,</seg>
<seg id="21"> but the camel, frightened by the camera flash, went completely beyond control and almost threw sun yanzi off onto the ground,</seg>
<seg id="22"> in the end sun yanzi leapt down on her own, however her carelessness caused her clothing to be ripped by the seat mat which scratched her back and left behind a small bloody mark about 8cm long.</seg>
<seg id="23"> on this trip, sun yanzi visited four local children who were seriously undernourished and ill.  among them was a four-month-old baby, weighing only 2.1kg, who didn't look like a human being at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> she said: "the sight of him saddened me.  his condition is really too extreme, but it should also be a problem of the mother, who should be taught about the right nutrition concept."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> club original: several frequently seen stages of learning from buffett: i am taking a stroll</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) stage 1: initial acquaintance with buffett gave you the feeling as though you had gotten an invaluable treasure, and you immediately put it into practice.  but at this time, your learning of buffett's concept is still not deep, not penetrative.  more often than not, much will be used wrongly, used haphazardly, and used blindly, so it's effective sometimes and ineffective some other times.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) stage 2: "outsmart" buffett.  after going through a period of learning and practice, almost every "intelligent person" will be pondering over a few questions: for example, what would a buffett with chinese characteristics be like?</seg>
<seg id="5"> should the theories of buffett be flexibly applied in china?</seg>
<seg id="6"> can we do better than buffett?</seg>
<seg id="7"> therefore this stage is mainly characterized by your presumption and blind arrogance in your search for a buffett theory with chinese characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="8"> after going through a period of practice, more often than not, it's still effective sometimes and ineffective some other times, with no continuity.  if you're lucky, it is best to take a little loss, and turn back early.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) stage 3: back to buffett.  after having gone through a few setbacks, you've finally come to realize that you're just a normal human being, not a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the expectations set to yourself should be a little lower, just earnestly learning from buffett would fully suffice.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the simplest, on the contrary, is the most effective, but simple methods often encompass profound theories, and these theories must be understood before simplicity can be carried out right to the end.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the performance of this stage is not great for short term results, not too little for long term results, and has continuity.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4) stage 4: "stubborn" buffett.  after tasting consistent results, the theories of buffett are basically entrenched in this stage, and your attitude toward non-buffett companies is complete indifference.</seg>
<seg id="14"> you continuously learn and deepen the understanding of buffett and put it into practice.  the performance at this stage is getting better and better results, with continuity, and entering a virtuous cycle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> for every stage the time needed by each individual varies and is related both to individual situations and luck.</seg>

<seg id="7"> three gunmen on a mountainous road apparently set their sights on this beautiful female driver, forcing the mid-size bus to stop and wanting to bring the female driver off the vehicle for some fun.  the female driver frantically shouted for help, yet all the bus passengers went absolutely silent.</seg>

<seg id="9"> the man was furious, shouting and clamoring for all the bus passengers to stop this barbaric behavior, but no one answered.  the female driver was dragged without restraint to the thick bushes in the forestry.</seg>
<seg id="10"> half an hour later, the three villains returned with the female driver whose clothing was disheveled.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the bus was about to continue on its journey.  the female driver wanted the wounded and bleeding thinly weak man to get off the bus.</seg>

<seg id="16"> what did you save me from?</seg>
<seg id="17"> the female driver denied vehemently, drawing secret laughter from a few passengers.</seg>

<seg id="22"> unexpectedly, the busload of passengers who turned a blind eye to the brutal act earlier, as though just awoken from sleep, banded together to persuade the man to alight the bus: get off quickly, we still have other matters, and can't afford any delay!</seg>
<seg id="23"> a few strong and burly passengers even thought of going forward to drag the middle-aged man off the bus, causing one to think of the plot in the story "boule de suif" written by maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> the three villains gloated, grinning gleefully.</seg>
<seg id="25"> among them was a black skinned scoundrel who unabashedly said: we brothers have played her well!</seg>
<seg id="26"> the other two villains also blabbered nonsense: she is my partner, it is none of your business!</seg>
<seg id="27"> a quarrel ensued, until that man's luggage was thrown out the bus window, and he was pushed violently down subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="28"> the bus was once again smoothly traveling on the mountainous road.  the female driver stroked her hair once, and pressed on the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="29"> the bus was reaching the hill-top, and would go downhill round the bend. on the left side of the bus was a road carved into the mountain, on the right was an overhanging steep cliff.</seg>
<seg id="30"> the bus quietly increased speed, and the female driver's face was extremely calm, both hands tightly gripping on the steering wheel, as tears glistened in the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="31"> one of the villains sort of detected something, and said: drive slowly, drive slowly, what the hell are you trying to do?</seg>
<seg id="32"> the female driver did not speak up.  the speed of the bus became faster and faster.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the villains attempted to grab the steering wheel, but instead the bus was like an arrow that had left its bowstring shooting towards the cliff...</seg>
<seg id="34"> on the next day, the local newspapers reported: fatal accident occurred at fuhu mountain range yesterday, a mid-size bus tumbled down the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="35"> the bus driver and thirteen passengers were all killed.</seg>

<seg id="1"> the dark side of train stations</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> recently i've been out for a few days.  traveling by train, i discovered the dark side of various train stations during the summer transportation season!</seg>
<seg id="3"> i wish to understand what is there to pay attention to at the various train stations.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i am from changsha, let's talk about the condition in changsha first, everyone going to changsha train station must take note of it!</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. train tickets that take forever to buy: at changsha train station, during every major holiday or the beginning and the end of school winter and summer recesses, it is absolutely impossible to buy tickets, even going early to queue would be futile.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the most flawless reply i've gotten from my query was that the travel agency has booked all the tickets!</seg>
<seg id="7"> but from ticket scalpers, just pay more money, you can get as many as can be.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. beware of fake tickets: the tickets from ticket scalpers might not be genuine.  shuangfen and xinhua in hunan got rich, one by relying on fake certificates and licenses, and the other by depending on fake silver coins and fake coins, so fake ticket is really no big deal!</seg>
<seg id="9"> to patch up is of the lowest class.  some fake tickets masquerade as real ones so well that even train staff can't tell apart!</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. who has touched my bill: when buying things in stores at the train station, one has to be extra careful!</seg>
<seg id="11"> if you wish to pay in small change, ha-ha, your bill will always be missing a corner, so you have to change to large denomination bills.</seg>
<seg id="12"> but after you have replaced them with large denomination bills, the shop owner would definitely say it can't be broken up after he has got it in his hand, and still want to accept your small bills missing a corner after returning your big bill, by this time you just have to take back a piece of fake big bill!</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. magician gives changes: not all shop owners will swap your big bill, as that is against the law, and the risk is higher!</seg>
<seg id="14"> therefore a few "timid" shop owners have to resort to being magicians. you clearly see him calculating the change to be correct, but wait till you have the chance to calculate on your own.  ha-ha, it's short of a few bills.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. foreign liquors everywhere: there are not too many teahouses at the train station, but after entering you will understand.</seg>
<seg id="16"> few glasses of inferior quality red wine can be sold at martell's price.  if you do not pay for it, probably even your mother will not recognize you afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. rose and firearms: around the train station are numerous video halls.  the titles of the shows played may still seem very attractive to us common men. so if you enter to take a look, you will surely be deemed as a distinguished guest with thoughts to relax.  then immediately a rose girl will come over to keep you company.  of course you have to be able to afford the expenses of a five-star hotel; otherwise the machete will not always be chopping in the direction of foreigners!</seg>
<seg id="18"> 7. ice and fire: if you have a changsha's accent or are very familiar with changsha, then you can forever give up the thought of getting a cab at the front of the station.  the face of the cab driver can let you know what is called a frosty june!</seg>
<seg id="19"> but if it is your first time coming to changsha, congratulations to you.   even if you are going to a place within five minutes' walking distance, the driver will warmly bring you to admire for a while some of the finesse in a state-level major tourist city, and will even let you have a gulp of the famous baisha brand secondhand smoke, and a sniff of the distinctly local taste of the betel nut.</seg>
<seg id="20"> of course, you have to fork out the transport fare on your own, don't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> nanjing subway driver should undergo psychological counseling as soon as possible</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> keywords: psychological counseling</seg>
<seg id="3"> according to the report by xinhua news agency, on the evening of july 3, a suicide was committed on the railway track of nanjing subway.</seg>
<seg id="4"> according to the description of the reporter, "zhu zhengting, age 22, a young subway driver, met with a nightmarish scene.  yesterday when the reporter met him, he seemed to have not yet recovered from the horror, sitting upright on the chair, and his eyes looked a little entranced."</seg>
<seg id="5"> obviously, the psychology of this young driver has been dealt with a huge blow and urgently requires psychological counseling, or would otherwise impair him for life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> not sure if everyone still remembers an incident that took place more than a decade ago.  the rescuer who saved a little girl from an abandoned oil well in the us state of texas finally chose to commit suicide and ended a painful life after having gone through long periods of psychological torture.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at that time, though he was put through simple psychological counseling, but, as people placed greater attention on the little girl who was rescued, yet neglecting the person who needed psychological counseling even more, they finally failed to prevent the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="8"> similarly, in the dover straits smuggling incident a few years back, the first british police officer that opened up the container was said to have fainted in fright on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="9"> subsequently, the british side carried out more than two months of psychological counseling on him before he had recovered and returned to normal.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the psychology of humans will sustain huge damages after suffering catastrophic shocks.  at this moment, it is very difficult to thoroughly recover depending solely on one's individual efforts.  an emotional scar will often be left behind.</seg>
<seg id="11"> as such emotional scar is very difficult to be discovered by outsiders, and even if it is discovered, there is nothing that can be done, most parties concerned will suffer for life.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, people in our country do not pay enough attention to caring about psychological trauma.  especially it is often after the optimum recovery period has lapsed that the family members or governing authorities of the parties concerned suddenly recall; it is all too late then.</seg>
<seg id="13"> nowadays, with the diversification of the media, we often hear of some heart-wrenching incidents, where many young teenage girls were hurt, and many young children saw with their own eyes the cruel sufferings inflicted on their own parents.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after these teenagers have been rescued, they are not often heard to have received psychological therapy; more often relatives are engaged in kinship solace.</seg>
<seg id="15"> even though victims may feel that they are already safe, the previous hurt has become a permanently incurable scar, always to be awoken, affecting the lives of the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="16"> it is gratifying to know that the superior of this driver has given him timely consolation which could also release some of his psychological pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17"> after all the responsibility of the incident does not lie with the driver and the driver has also taken all measures when he discovered the situation.  he has done all he could except for stopping the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i believe that even if it is not the driver concerned, anyone present at the scene would have been given a fright with the happening of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="19"> however, despite being given a fright, the others have no connection of responsibility to the suicide victim and can gradually forget over time.</seg>
<seg id="20"> the driver concerned is not so lucky; he has to remember, and probably for life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> if he can free himself from it, he can count his blessings; but if he cannot free himself from it, he will often be tortured by such a fright.</seg>
<seg id="22"> the modern concept of health is more comprehensive than in the past, and mental health has started to be watched closely by people.</seg>
<seg id="23"> it is regrettable that the mental state of mankind is depressing, especially in cities, where the mental state of people is not ideal, and most people more or less have hidden depression, while some people have not been able to arouse adequate attention when they are faced with problems.</seg>
<seg id="24"> thinking about the earlier lesson with the "yang lijuan incident," some irresponsible media have made the torturous mental issue of a patient as a tabloid subject, causing bad influence to society,</seg>
<seg id="25"> such incidents should be prevented in the future, otherwise our society will really become a morbid society.</seg>

<seg id="3"> at the same time they also feel that the new curriculum reform is a rare opportunity and challenge to the school education advancement.</seg>
<seg id="4"> on the morning of the 13th, due to the road repair on sections of dongkou's shijiang and longhui road causing vehicles to be blocked, by the time the few teachers of dongkou no.5 middle school and the teachers from suining and other locations rushed to the city department of education, it was already past 1pm, and already long past office hours, yet the education department staff unloaded the training materials that were already loaded onto the vehicle, just to process relevant procedures for us.  we collected the training materials.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at 2:30 in the afternoon, the teachers who were dust covered and tired from traveling braved the summer heat and separately entered city no.1 middle school, city no.2 middle school, and city no.6 middle school multimedia classrooms to listen to the lectures by relevant experts.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in the subsequent two days, the teachers either listened to the lectures given by authors of the teaching materials or listened to the teaching experiences of the teachers from the provinces that have already entered the new curriculum reform.  some of teaching researchers or teachers who had participated in the new provincial curriculum training also presented their learning experiences and gains.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on the morning of the 15th, after listening to all the training courses, there was also an exam.  the five teachers from dongkou no.5 middle school, due to their conscientious learning, with no tardiness nor leaving early, had smoothly passed the examination and received their completion certificates.</seg>
<seg id="8"> during training periods, teachers of dongkou no.5 middle school had mutual exchanges amongst themselves.  initially they all felt that the new curriculum tends to be rather unfamiliar, heavier in assignments, have greater pressure, and not easy to grasp.</seg>
<seg id="9"> however, after the training, everyone felt that this is also an opportunity and a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> all were determined to strive to adjust their knowledge structure, and satisfactorily complete the task of curriculum reform as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the second batch of teachers participating in the new curriculum training has already arrived on the 16th at relevant locations to undergo training.</seg>

<seg id="4"> i told her directly, i truly admire you!</seg>
<seg id="5"> because you have directly expressed your love.</seg>
<seg id="6"> she likes this male host of a popular taiwan variety program and never conceals such feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7"> when this male host was presenting a program in jinan, she flew to jinan; when this male host went to changsha as a guest performer, she flew to changsha.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the male host said in a book that a friend gave him a catapult with no pellets, and she told me in pleasant surprise that "the catapult was given by me."</seg>
<seg id="9"> she also participated in doing up an e-magazine on this superstar, and she'd show me every edition very happily.</seg>
<seg id="10"> all along i pretty much like to associate with some of those people who honestly identify themselves as fans of certain superstars.</seg>
<seg id="11"> these superstars can be movie or tv stars, sports stars, or can also be a great man.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i've never felt these friends to be superficial, and i feel that they are so adorable.</seg>
<seg id="13"> these people are usually genuine in nature, like means like, dislike means dislike.</seg>
<seg id="14"> to be in contact with this type of people, it will be very relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> even though they will not take into consideration 100% of your feelings, at least you do know what they are happy and sad about; and know that there will be a greater sense of security associating with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> these people are also very honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> do you know that with regard to expressing one's likes, some bravery is also needed?</seg>
<seg id="18"> because of this, many people just silently like one person in a lifetime, or perhaps he might also look down on those who brazenly claim to be a fan of so-and-so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> honesty is to me the biggest virtue in a person, be honest to friends, and be honest to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> but to achieve this point is actually very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="21"> to be able to like a celebrity also proves that deep in his heart there are selfless elements.</seg>
<seg id="22"> some of my friends are fans of some superstars.</seg>
<seg id="23"> sometimes in order to take a glance at the superstar, they can endure hardship and can make many sacrifices, scrimping to eat less, with the left hand raising a banner, and the right hand clicking the camera, while the mouth is screaming away.</seg>
<seg id="24"> it can be said that they are foolish, immature, but to be able to love someone without asking for any returns, this requires much selflessness.</seg>
<seg id="25"> because in reality there are so much narcissism, self-conceitedness, and nonchalance toward others that this selflessness appears to be valuable.</seg>
<seg id="26"> thus, when everyone starts to chat and talk about one's likes for so-and-so superstar, if someone should say that i have never idolized anyone,</seg>
<seg id="27"> ha-ha, you must be careful then.</seg>

<seg id="1"> teresa cheung, the person</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> keywords: teresa cheung</seg>
<seg id="3"> by chance i watched an edition of the kangxi come, starring teresa cheung, that i haven't seen for ages.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i think that was when color blossoms was being promoted.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at the time i watched color blossoms, i was obsessed with erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> at that time i was surprised that pornographic movies could be made with such aesthetic appeal, and are also sometimes very interesting.  they are called erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> actually i have not seen many erotic movies, but they have been from quite a few countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the very first ones i saw were south korean and japanese.</seg>
<seg id="9"> later i also saw several movies from countries of the third world, latin america, and europe, but i seldom saw hollywood or french movies.</seg>
<seg id="10"> of these, there are two movies which i can't bear to delete from my computer.  one is youth, the other is color blossoms.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the first half of color blossoms is pretty good.  everyone is a newcomer, putting forth a lot of effort in acting.  the director is also disciplined.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the latter half is somewhat abnormal.  i could not take it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> in fact what i want to say is that teresa cheung says on the program that she has had boyfriends in almost every country in the world, except in africa.</seg>
<seg id="14"> at present, she has four boyfriends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> regarding this, i am afraid average people cannot take this.  they would say this person is loose.</seg>
<seg id="16"> but the key issue is she was very candid when talking about these issues, did not carry herself in any way that would make people uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="17"> she also talked about her own thoughts about love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> for instance, both people should be financially independent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i assume that personalities should also be independent; so each controls their own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="20"> for i know that when people are in love, love is living, is selfish.  how can you allow the person you love to accept someone else's love at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="21"> based on my experience and assumptions, i think teresa cheung's love must not have been simple sentimentality.  it must have been typical elder-sister-younger-brother love.</seg>
<seg id="22"> in elder-sister-younger-brother love, the elder sister can accommodate anything, including possessing several younger brothers at the same time.  meanwhile, the younger brother can emotionally become attached to the elder sister without reservation, because of her attractiveness and motherliness.  however, he perhaps does not mind whether he is the only one, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="23"> but from teresa cheung's words, i also noticed that she is actually a person who really knows how to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="24"> for instance, she loves to travel to the point of being +crazy.</seg>
<seg id="25"> so i have reason to believe that she also has a very splendid life.</seg>
<seg id="26"> if this was before, i'm afraid that i would not have accepted these phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="27"> similarly, i have now accepted many people.  in fact this has little to do with tolerance.  rather, as long as one straightens his thoughts, there won't be any absolute love or non-love.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these people are, for instance, passerby a, friend b, zhang ziyi, buddy c, and sister lotus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when looking at other people's lives, you yourself are an observer.  to other people, how can you not be the owner of your own life?</seg>
<seg id="30"> this is just like: although i am no longer in jianghu, my legend will always be in jianghu.</seg>

<seg id="3"> a person's life is a very tiring thing, so we should have some entertaining spirit.</seg>
<seg id="4"> either satirize ourselves, or see others making fools of themselves, gossip about others.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for instance, go to tian ya's "entertaining gossip" board and relax.</seg>
<seg id="6"> inside, everybody speaks freely.  but of course, you should have some ability to tell right from wrong, because various "wrongs" occur all the time.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the consequence of "say whatever you want" is that you end up not knowing what you are talking about.  yet you should be clear about what you are looking at.</seg>
<seg id="8"> little s called kevin tsai a "scholar."</seg>
<seg id="9"> if i am considered one, then i'd be the type who has read a little bit, but has not yet fully grasped the meaning.</seg>
<seg id="10"> fortunately, i would always know my own limitations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but simply put, in doing a little bit of reading, i have gotten some things that i wanted to get.</seg>
<seg id="12"> and it so happens that i like to think aimlessly, so i think while reading, and that way get to understand many truths, many things become suddenly clear.</seg>
<seg id="13"> therefore, i have slowly cultivated some habits.  for example, i tell myself to be a bit harder on myself, and a bit nicer to others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> whenever encountering a problem, first search for an explanation within myself.</seg>
<seg id="15"> handle things with a little bit of reason, handle friendship with a little bit of emotion.</seg>
<seg id="16"> be a reserved person, do things with a low profile.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but you know, people are not that good.  they will always be selfish, will always consider their own gains and losses, will always be extremely emotional when reason is called for, and damned rational when it is time for passion.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the good thing is, i won't regret the choices i make.</seg>
<seg id="19"> what's done is done, i accept the consequences of failure.</seg>
<seg id="20"> why think about so many useless things.</seg>
<seg id="21"> it's good that i am not that kind of uptight person, acting in ways to enhance my scholarly status.  i am just an ordinary person.</seg>
<seg id="22"> only i'm different from some people in that i don't have to be cynical, i'm a little bit rational with everything.</seg>
<seg id="23"> or for instance, my faith is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="24"> once i come to trust someone, then i believe everything about him is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> if there are deficiencies, i am more than willing to accommodate them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> even though i'm not the kind of person who is surrounded by friends, i'm the type who puts oneself in friends' shoes.</seg>
<seg id="27"> but because of this, i'm quite serious in choosing friends.</seg>
<seg id="28"> i also really can't understand why currently there are so many people who believe so much of what's in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="29"> or else in their minds, reports nowadays are just as sacred as in the past.</seg>

<seg id="3"> i recently read in the newspaper that song dandan has newly published a book called the secrets of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i really wanted to read it,</seg>
<seg id="5"> because i wondered how a woman who has reached this age, having this kind of profession, having experienced changes in family and career, after these, would perceive herself and life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> as expected, i was not disappointed.  after reading it, there were two things that touched me: first, it was like i got an electric shock, for looking at other people's lives can be the same as seeing one's own shadow; second, i was very moved by the detailed aspects of some close family relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7"> why did i get an electric shock?</seg>
<seg id="8"> song dandan wrote in the book: "i overlooked an important principle in life: giving is more rewarding than receiving."</seg>
<seg id="9"> "i am always busy with giving, busy making myself happy."</seg>
<seg id="10"> i cannot, nor do i really know how to receive.  i overlooked allowing others to give, that is, overlooked other people's right to achieve happiness."</seg>
<seg id="11"> i realized that i myself have been enjoying such happiness.  i probably should pay some attention to this matter in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12"> if one can honestly face one's past, present it all to the public, this takes substantial courage.</seg>
<seg id="13"> this book covers her first love, her unsuccessful marriage with ying da, as well as in-depth self analysis, and the close relationship with her son.</seg>
<seg id="14"> this book is also worth praising for another point, because the publisher originally must have pushed her very hard to focus on i love my family, ambush from all sides, and the series of shows partnered with zhao benshan.</seg>
<seg id="15"> yet she must have persevered, with zhao benshan only mentioned at the very end.  as for ambush from all sides and i love my family, they are hardly mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="16"> this book is suffused with a 40-year-old woman's insights about life, love, family, and relationships.  it is warm and touching.</seg>

<seg id="3"> i have been on vacation for nearly a week, but still haven't had any free time.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i went to the university for a meeting, and have to prepare documents and a draft speech for a meeting i will attend next week.</seg>
<seg id="5"> this vacation is going to be very busy.</seg>
<seg id="6"> if nothing unexpected happens, according to my plan, there are three meetings to attend, four or five cities to go to.</seg>
<seg id="7"> life is suddenly filled with many contents, of the same and different categories.  i have almost forgotten how vacations were spent in the past.</seg>
<seg id="8"> it seems from my memories that there wasn't much free time, either.</seg>
<seg id="9"> it's only that in the past, i used to have long periods of time that i could arrange myself, while this year there seems to be less time.</seg>
<seg id="10"> good thing?  or bad thing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> being busy can be more gratifying, but if it yields no effects or accomplishments, the importance of being busy has to be discounted.</seg>
<seg id="12"> but sometimes it seems that life cannot be entirely measured by effects.  life is to be enjoyed leisurely.  being relaxed, peaceful, fulfilled, and happy is also a kind of achievement, even though sometimes such achievement can't be measured by the standard of social evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="13"> everyone needs to be recognized according to social values and self values.  if the two can't be obtained together, what can we do?</seg>
<seg id="14"> marxism teaches us to first respect social values, asking individuals to make contributions to society.  but in fact, a healthy and sound society should also fully respect individuals' wishes and value choices, and create conditions for realizing individual values.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i suddenly thought about these, and increasingly discovered that the marxist theory is really very effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> surely, it's true in theory, but sometimes people in real life will inevitably get confused.</seg>
<seg id="17"> even if realizing self values would not jeopardize social values, would each of us actual individuals content ourselves with truthful self realization without worrying about social evaluation?</seg>
<seg id="18"> or can our satisfaction with self values depart from social evaluation?</seg>
<seg id="19"> it seems very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20"> therefore each of us, while trying our best to be good ordinary and common individuals, will inevitably seek the uncommon and extraordinary; but if life is wasted, we will always blame ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="21"> this is probably one social characteristic of people.</seg>
<seg id="22"> going on vacation, it has been somewhat relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="23"> at a minimum, i can have time to watch dvds, can relax and play for awhile.</seg>
<seg id="24"> just a couple of thoughts, work has to be done, the days go on as usual.</seg>
<seg id="25"> next week again, i have to go to xi'an for a meeting.</seg>

<seg id="9"> men finally become the "subject" from being the "spectator," while women, who were previously "objects," become "principal parties" and can, from an observer's point of view, appreciate and face a variety of male talent shows in this pretty boy's era.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ying said this is a woman's liberation and is kind of a feminism hallmark.</seg>
<seg id="11"> then she went on to say: "don't you feel that you are living very much like a feminist?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> hearing ying's remark, i laughed aloud happily.</seg>
<seg id="13"> this remark itself is significantly filled with feminism, only that i do not have as good a discerning ability as ying's to be able to elaborate on these things more profoundly and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i like the song by chen chusheng on happy boys very much.  there is a kind of special touch, the kind of strength that pin-points to a person's heart and penetrates through space and time, extremely crystal-clear and very soothing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> su xing's songs have got many styles, with plentiful feelings.  his features are elegant and gentle, yet giving people a feel of relaxation and cheeriness.</seg>
<seg id="16"> zhang jie's songs are full of resonance and energy, especially the two songs he presented challengingly today, the way you are and past gone with the wind, both of which are oldies that i like very much, with a deep impression.</seg>
<seg id="17"> wei chen bears a resemblance to lu yi's cute and fresh face.  he was said to be well liked by girls, and of course the voice is not bad too.</seg>
<seg id="18"> with these top four contesting at the next stage, this should be good to watch.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i'm looking forward to watching their exciting performance next week!</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> keywords: kimchi, seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> jun. 29, a day of confused and mixed "kimchi" feeling  international roaming has been activated, but after disembarking from the plane, the cellular phone seems as though to have a flat battery, still not displaying even one bar of reception, perhaps the extent of global roaming refers to the reach of the heart, and takes effect only upon the next payment due date.</seg>
<seg id="4"> for the next few days, i will be out of touch with everyone for a brief period.  ha-ha, will anyone worry for me as a result?</seg>
<seg id="5"> switching on the voicemail service is only a wish to prove who are the ones missing me.</seg>
<seg id="6"> whether it is for business or personal.</seg>
<seg id="7"> but the issue is, who do i wish to be missed by?</seg>
<seg id="8"> my heart, i wonder when it has started, is becoming blank again.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i don't understand why there will always be some people whom you wish for them to stay but just can't hold them back, while there will be those whom you don't wish for them to stay but they always think that they can squeeze themselves in.  is this like discussing the business world?</seg>
<seg id="10"> but can the heart, regardless whether there is a place for you or not, always allow itself to be stuffed with these "white gloves?"</seg>
<seg id="11"> after all, materialism and the heart just cannot be equally compared!</seg>
<seg id="12"> our vehicle is driving along the highway to busan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the department chief is driving without uttering a word, and there's nothing for me to speak up either,</seg>
<seg id="14"> after all he does not understand chinese nor comprehend english, while i merely speak a few expressions in broken english.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i'm looking at the computer and striking on the keyboard in considerable boredom, besides the noise of the keyboard in the vehicle, there's the cheerful voice of the korean girl from the gprs navigation device, and everything seems to be exceptionally calm.</seg>
<seg id="16"> out of the window, all that could be seen is merely the uninterrupted greenery and grayish blue sky.</seg>
<seg id="17"> keeping silent doesn't seem much to be my character.</seg>
<seg id="18"> unexpectedly, english is the only thing that induced a sense of endearment to me in this country,</seg>
<seg id="19"> to me, the scene of circles appearing before my eyes no longer has any other function except for inducing the effect of dizziness caused by radiation.</seg>
<seg id="20"> i think, korea will definitely not be producing compasses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> because, there is no demand in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22"> seoul is very clean, thoroughly clean, meticulously clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> unfortunately, during my few days of stay in seoul, i didn't have the time to visit other places besides the work place and the department store; all impression was limited purely to the views along the road.</seg>
<seg id="24"> fortunately, everything still remains lovely!</seg>
<seg id="25"> koreans are traditionally courteous, a methodical smile, intent listening, refined and sedate,</seg>
<seg id="26"> all that can be observed is the beautiful appearance, traditional customs, ancient architectures, and the scrupulous civilization.</seg>
<seg id="27"> is this hypocritical?</seg>
<seg id="28"> it is still better to be hypocritical, at least everyone is polite!</seg>
<seg id="29"> the ugly side of things that is not seen may be perceived as non-existent.</seg>
<seg id="30"> korea cuisine is excellent!</seg>
<seg id="31"> just that i don't like and don't understand why is it that all the choices here and there are just kimchi presented in different forms and assortment, and of course, seaweed is indispensable too.</seg>
<seg id="32"> in retrospect, koreans are very adept in their gastronomical knowledge.  they can differentiate the difference between kimchi preserved above ground or underground, as well as the length of time, where the precision can be down to the minute.</seg>
<seg id="33"> this indirectly shows that the conscientiousness of koreans may be related to their consumption of kimchi from morning till night.</seg>
<seg id="34"> the only headache is that i don't know what kind of recipe combining kimchi will be used at that japanese tofu restaurant the department chief is bringing us to.</seg>
<seg id="35"> recalling the chinese cuisine last night, i sort of felt like crying.  the dishes were all localized to suit the korean taste, and the only thing edible ended up to be kimchi.</seg>
<seg id="36"> ah, thanks to china southern airlines that provides kimchi along with its in-flight meal.</seg>
<seg id="37"> the airline must think that i should start adapting right from the moment i board the plane.</seg>
<seg id="38"> two more days to go before i return to my country.  if there is still no one i might miss, then it is better off to reminisce the braised meat prepared by auntie.</seg>
<seg id="39"> after all, contentment of the stomach is relatively more direct than the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> naturally, this has nothing to do with kimchi.</seg>

<seg id="1"> two trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> two trees, one is me, the other was my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> we mutually provided shade and took care of each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> people of my generation typically have many children, but i only have elder and younger sisters, no brothers at all, hence the appearance of my brother-in-law was extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="5"> we are all kids from poor background, joining in the numerous family chores since young.  although i had been striving to put on a manly front all along and wishing to complete the tasks like an expert, recognition from my father was never received.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i had the disorder of sleep walking since young.  though not too serious, it was inevitable that i was absent-minded when doing the house chores.</seg>
<seg id="7"> for example, my dad wanted me to patch up some cement to the chimney of our old house, and i deftly climbed up the roof to do it.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the chimney was patched up fine, but when rain came, the house leaked with water, the reason being that i had trampled on the roof tiles and broke them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> take for another example, my dad asked me to change the light bulb, the kind with old fashioned incandescent bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="10"> by the time i stepped onto the stool, the bulb had instead dropped from the grip of my hands onto the concrete floor and shattered.</seg>
<seg id="11"> examples like these are too numerous to give; therefore when my brother-in-law entered my family, these nitty-gritty tasks were naturally undertaken by him, and they were beautifully done, not requiring any outlay of labor cost.</seg>
<seg id="12"> meanwhile, i was happily stashed away in a corner reading those brick-like books leisurely.</seg>
<seg id="13"> after that we grew into two trees, two large trees that could sufficiently support the pillar of a family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> and my dad was inevitably diminished, and sitting in his wheelchair, he has become an anonymous shrub under the dense shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> who would have expected the sudden change in situation when my 50-year old brother-in-law suddenly came down with a serious illness.  it was hard to believe that this green and luxuriant big tree on the surface was approaching that fearful death.</seg>
<seg id="16"> on that dazzlingly sunny summer day, just outside of the operation room in peking union medical college hospital, the doctor delicately said: there is no value in surgery anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17"> at most he can live for another two months.</seg>
<seg id="18"> at that moment i felt like i was suddenly being shot by a stray bullet; my soul had instantly left my body, and i stood there rigidly like an idiot.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i started to sleep walk again, seeing the old courtyard of our house, and the busy figure of my young brother-in-law in the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="20"> it was the screech of my elder sister that awoke me.  i hurriedly ran to hug my sister who had collapsed on the corridor of the hospital; our tears flowed all over our faces as we hugged together.</seg>
<seg id="21"> the bright sun had suddenly disappeared, and darkness formed before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22"> after returning to our city from beijing, my brother-in-law knew of his own condition very quickly, and after a session of bitter crying with my elder sister, his mood returned back to normal instead.</seg>
<seg id="23"> my brother-in-law started to methodically go about his after death arrangements, for example, telling his own son: take care of your granny for me; her remains are to be placed together with your granddad's after her death, and this is how the tomb should be opened up to put the bones together.</seg>
<seg id="24"> go and visit your maternal grandfather often, and buy some practical stuff for him to use on holidays and new year.</seg>
<seg id="25"> for example, he said to my younger sister: after i leave, you must come often to see your elder sister, for she will definitely feel very lonely being all alone.</seg>
<seg id="26"> i did my best to find time to visit him.  when facing me, he looked regretful instead.</seg>
<seg id="27"> we often had nothing to say facing each other, just like two trees unable to speak to each other though they are alive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these are two grown trees, the training and experience from the elements have made us able to face difficulties calmly, what is there to relay to me?</seg>
<seg id="29"> it seemed that there was no need to do so.</seg>
<seg id="30"> because you know in your heart: after you leave, my elder sister, and your children with my elder sister, and this big family, can only depend on this tree which is me for sole support.</seg>
<seg id="31"> why am i born a man?</seg>
<seg id="32"> as a man, regardless whether you are willing or not, you have to lift up your shoulders without hesitation and undertake the duty.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the only regretful thing is: why would your tree wither so early, shouldn't you have a rich and splendid old age?</seg>
<seg id="34"> the day you left was the first day of the chinese new year.</seg>
<seg id="35"> it was a time when chinese all over the world happily ushered in the new spring, yet you left on your own.</seg>
<seg id="36"> perhaps in another dimension, there is the birth of yet another new young life?</seg>

<seg id="1"> the n-minutes of life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> the reason to have such a fashionable looking topic is because in that moment of extreme despair, the hazy mind is absolutely too occupied to care about time.</seg>
<seg id="3"> like an innocent one, receiving a death sentence ruling out of thin air, can he still calmly challenge the grammar errors in the "verdict?"</seg>
<seg id="4"> that was a winter's day, and it was cold in the youth section.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i don't know who was on duty for the day, and there was no fire set up in the fireplace for the whole day.</seg>
<seg id="6"> because there were rumors of strong earthquake, upon returning back indoors in the evening, we were just too lazy to start the fire again.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on the long wide bed which could sleep 12 people, the four of us wrapped ourselves in cotton quilts, and were playing the poker game of "3-beat-1" while trembling under the dim lights, to win our meal tickets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> suddenly, a surging noise from afar was approaching.  the few of us looked at one another just for a brief moment and immediately became aware of the impending catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> so we threw aside the cards in our hands, threw ourselves to the ground, squeezed through two narrow room doors, and swarmed out.</seg>
<seg id="10"> just at that moment when we ran out from our dormitory, that poor thatched cottage laid from stones was reduced to rubbles in a flash.</seg>
<seg id="11"> those of us who rushed to the courtyard felt as if we were standing on a staggering boat, like a tumbler rocking front and back, unable to stand steady.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in those few seconds, all the buildings around us, +contrary to the past stable images, were emitting weird "creaking" sounds one after another, swaying to a close to frenetic break dance before being reduced to a grimy death.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the overhead electrical cable lines were naturally unwilling to be left out, "bang" and broken, they scattered like whips in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> and in front and behind of us, the raging earthquake demon was displaying its fireworks in celebration of its own creativity, the multi-colored flashes of earth light could compete with the visual effects of any major war film and the rumbling sounds from the ground, like the battle drumbeats, were torturing every fragile nerve tract.</seg>
<seg id="15"> there was only one thought in my mind: doomsday has already arrived for mankind!</seg>
<seg id="16"> i can imagine: the earth under my feet abruptly opens up, while the boiling magma issues a blazing invitation like the steel melt, mankind starts free-falling like mole crickets and ants in droves into the magna, too stingy to leave even a trace of blue smoke, all vanishing instantly.</seg>
<seg id="17"> my spine felt a pleasant numbness as if icy water was being injected; the faces of my few companions were like paper masks floating in and out of the dimness.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i was thinking: was mankind just going to say goodbye to this colorful world this way?  were tens of thousands of years of civilization vanishing without a trace from this moment on?</seg>
<seg id="19"> but i was not even 20 years old yet, the flowery youth had just blossomed, and the perception of joy in life was just forming, i was so reluctant to part from this beautiful life!</seg>
<seg id="20"> my parents and my loved ones, where are all of you, what are you doing, are you all still alive in this world?</seg>
<seg id="21"> facing the sneering face of death at this moment, how i miss you!</seg>
<seg id="22"> ...i didn't know how much time had passed before the muddle-headed me finally discovered in joy that the sound coming from the ground was gradually weakening, with the shaking of the earth getting slower and slower, and the fireworks above my head were no longer scintillating.</seg>
<seg id="23"> a giant battleship tossing in the terrifying waves had finally sailed slowly into a tranquil harbor.</seg>
<seg id="24"> a young and fragile heart had finally been gingerly placed back into its original position after weathering through near insane havoc.</seg>
<seg id="25"> oh this earth, my homeland, you have finally let us feel the warmth and endearment of home once again!</seg>
<seg id="26"> a sense of blissfulness after surviving a calamity filled me up like a warm current from the bottom of my feet to my entire body.</seg>
<seg id="27"> facing what was once a cordial and warm youth section courtyard which had now become a wasteland of rubbles, yu doudou, who had just passed the age of 17, steadied herself and suddenly burst out crying.</seg>
<seg id="28"> everyone was infected and hot tears flowed all over.</seg>
<seg id="29"> snow started to drop from the sky, was it condolence fluttering down for the misfortune of mankind?</seg>
<seg id="30"> that year, the haicheng earthquake took away as many as 1,000 lives.</seg>
<seg id="31"> experts said: thanks to the timely prediction, and the fact that it occurred at a time when people were not asleep, otherwise a strong earthquake measuring 7.3 magnitudes would have taken at least the lives of 100,000 people!</seg>
<seg id="32"> merely a year apart, the tangshan earthquake erupted, and over 200,000 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1"> those matters in the village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> there are many families in the village, among them is a nan family that is the most detestable.  there is a well-known remark circulating in the village: beware of fire, beware of theft and beware of the nans.</seg>
<seg id="3"> in fact the whole family of nan is still rather honest in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="4"> some families will steal a melon or something from the land of others on normal days, and the members of the nan family are just committing petty theft, and the nans need not be isolated to the extent by everyone in the whole village.</seg>
<seg id="5"> everyone is not clean, who has been offended by members of my nan family?</seg>
<seg id="6"> the nan family started organizing some very prestigious activities to show that this village was built initially by the ancestors of the nan family and that the nan family has always been a major family growing grains.  in addition it has fostered some well-known individuals in history as well as contributed significantly to the building of this village.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the same time, the members of the nan family have intimately invited the cadres of the village to their home to take a look and have a seat.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in short, the members of the nan family are very diligent, wanting to fight a proactive battle and striving to be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, the xi family did a very disgraceful thing, carrying out brutal persecution towards the seedlings of the nan family.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the xi family depends on matchmaking for their fame in the village, and all the young men in the village have benefited from the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="11"> if it hadn't been for the good matchmaking done by the xi family, how would all these families and households have been able to produce so well!</seg>
<seg id="12"> however this time round, the xi family actually used black bricks to crush the seedlings of the nan family at a place called hong dong.  it was utterly despicable, and the whole village was infuriated, all remarking that there is no good person in the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the nan family demanded an explanation from the xi family, arousing the sympathy from everyone in the whole village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> everyone in the village spitted in the direction of the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="15"> hence, the battleground was relocated to the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="16"> the nan family is determined to create a good image prior to the 17th village meeting and let this most flourishing nan family prosper.</seg>
<seg id="17"> though the cadres of the village have daily advised everyone to live in harmony, this village called zhong is never peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the most repugnant thing is that in the short period of two to three months, even the pigs have started to clamor for revolt, demanding for a rise of their own value!</seg>
<seg id="19"> two years ago, when chickens suffered from flu in various villages, weren't they all killed?</seg>
<seg id="20"> why don't you pigs have no brains?</seg>
<seg id="21"> you can clamor for revolution, but you can't escape from being beheaded!</seg>
<seg id="22"> and mei village and ying village which are used to bullying people may not seem to be peaceful either, even though their days are well-off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> there were some vagrants, knocking down tall buildings in mei village today, and throwing some small explosive cans to the subway of ying village tomorrow, that is scary enough to people, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="24"> therefore, the people of zhong village generally feel that though it is disgusting not to be able to afford houses, treat their illnesses, or go to school, being able to peacefully do some farming, take on some work, and build up some relationship can be also considered stepping into the new era.</seg>
<seg id="25"> the nan family, and the xi family, ah, which family doesn't have their own undisclosed dilemmas?</seg>
<seg id="26"> take for example members of the wan family residing at a little bend in the southeastern part of the village.  though the head of this household is a little shameless, isn't it that our great zhong village still shelters this family just the same?</seg>
<seg id="27"> with the 2008 all village sports meet to be held in our zhong village soon, save some energy on those trivial matters in the village and reform those delinquent children in the village.</seg>
<seg id="28"> all families and households, light up and start the fire.  those who have money contribute with money, and those who have strength contribute with strength.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when the time comes, everyone goes to the village town hall to watch the golden egg being laid in the bird's nest!</seg>
<seg id="30"> (dubbing outside the picture, weakening: golden egg or silver egg?  dear viewers, dear viewers, this is brother yong, the host of the village tv station...)</seg>

<seg id="4"> upon hearing of this, we humble people at the grassroots cannot help laughing out loud.  to catch thieves, the police issue an ultimatum asking thieves to voluntarily confess to their crimes before a deadline one month away. or else they'll be arrested.  can you find any anti-corruption campaign of the same pattern?</seg>
<seg id="5"> isn't that tantamount to a clear, public announcement telling corrupt officials in advance to flee at once and to doctor the criminal evidences to avoid punishment?</seg>
<seg id="6"> what is the intention?</seg>
<seg id="7"> isn't that .. .. sigh, what can i say!</seg>
<seg id="8"> or, if we assume the campaign may be productive, what effect can it achieve?</seg>
<seg id="9"> can it instill fear into the corrupt officials and deter them?</seg>
<seg id="10"> we do not rule out the possibility that some timid ones might come out and voluntarily confess. but wouldn't many many more just run away?</seg>
<seg id="11"> let's not ask whether the deadline set by the central commission for discipline will produce clear effect.  just watch for the possible side effect in a different direction that this campaign would likely produce.</seg>
<seg id="12"> that is: the corrupt officials' gratitude toward the central commission for discipline. corrupted officials fully understand the situation and secretly feel the joy of going scotch free from any punishment.</seg>
<seg id="13"> one month would be more than enough for them to transfer and squirrel away their loot.</seg>
<seg id="14"> if i were a corrupt official, absolutely, i would also see things that way.  definitely, neither would i go to your place and voluntarily report everything.</seg>
<seg id="15"> corrupt officials, after reveling in joy and gratitude, will behave themselves this way.  ha, ha. very gratefully!</seg>
<seg id="16"> common folks are all confused. what happened to the anti-corruption campaign?  why can't we push forward with all the powers of hurricane and thunder? why is it so difficult to strike out resolutely?</seg>
<seg id="17"> what results can we expect from an anti-corruption campaign like this?</seg>
<seg id="18"> honorable members of the central commission for discipline, all in all, i am wary and worried over the effect your "anti-corruption deadline" will produce.</seg>

<seg id="1"> no private land ownership is minimum acceptable to my calm, rational self</seg>

<seg id="2"> [zen buddhist teacher duchi] [send text messages] and [table view] posted at 10:34:39 on july 2, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3"> not to privatize land ownership is the last line of defense i could accept with calm and ease.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i think i am not easily angered.  at least i myself feel this way.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i have always been calm and rational when speaking on forums, i seldom lose my composure and make irrational remarks.</seg>
<seg id="6"> also i have kept my profound faith in, and fervent expectations of the party's central committee. i accept decisions the party central makes to push through reformation policies and measures, no matter how wide is the difference between them and my beliefs, and i consider them as one of the "characteristics".</seg>
<seg id="7"> but, once land ownership begins to be privatized (or be privatized in substance, if not in name), all the above will not hold true any more because their raison d'etre will no longer be valid.</seg>
<seg id="8"> rather suffer the loss of a thousand troops than lose one inch of national territory.  land is the country's greatest and most precious social resource.</seg>
<seg id="9"> the working masses and the land are the fundamental elements of a country.</seg>
<seg id="10"> as long as the nature of its land resources remain unchanged, a country will not easily change her own basic nature and attributes.  once the land resources changed its basic nature, the change alters everything that is fundamental.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i am not a communist party member, but i clearly remember the following pledge i have sworn to: "love the motherland, love the people, study diligently, improve and strengthen myself, and be ever ready to offer my strength to serve the course of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="12"> "study diligently, work hard, suffer the hardships at first and enjoy the fruits later.  strive for the course of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="13"> those who, like me, have made this pledge and sung loudly these words "we belong to the next shift in socialism," should remember what they have sworn to, if they are not wretchedly shameless.</seg>
<seg id="14"> if you have already gone back completely on your pledge, please stand up in all honesty and move yourself away from "communism."  don't hang on to this plaque for the purpose of hoodwinking the masses on the one hand, and on he other hand, trying hard to figure out a way of selling the plaque off at a good price.</seg>
<seg id="15"> of course, i wish that all such concerns and worries were unnecessary, and i can keep my composure and rational behavior.</seg>
<seg id="16"> do remember that "we belong to the next shift in socialism."</seg>
<seg id="17"> what would happen when there is no more next shift?</seg>

<seg id="1"> one generation, feeling of two ages</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> not long ago, someone brought up this question: of 30-year-olds, are there some pro-mao zedong people?</seg>
<seg id="3"> later, it was changed to 20.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the fact is: people of these age groups did not live through the mao zedong era. those who asked this question either have poured water into their brains, or are afflicted with inherent dementia.</seg>
<seg id="5"> in the city, the most qualified spokespersons of the mao zedong era should be those who lived through these years in person and suffered all the miseries of that era, in other words, people born between 1950 and 1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> after they were born, their parents plunged into political movements, thus failing to provide the children love and care corresponding to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="7"> just when they needed proper nutrition, natural disasters arose and lasted for three years.  the children suffered much of the pains of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="8"> when starting school, they met head on with the cultural revolution that wiped out opportunities of schooling for many years.</seg>
<seg id="9"> for some, it even cut short their schooling for life.  at 15 to 17, their schooling still had a long way to go.  but they had to abandon their study in order to answer the call of the party to "climb the mountains, go to the countryside and support the constructions on the frontier."</seg>
<seg id="10"> after starting their work, they were proud to become members of the worker class and volunteered for the heaviest and most exhausting jobs.</seg>
<seg id="11"> glory for that moment, but misery for the whole life.</seg>
<seg id="12"> when it was time for them to get married, late marriage, late child-bearing and the one-family-one-baby policy also started from them.</seg>
<seg id="13"> when their pay was due to be raised, businesses started to put more value on school diplomas.  and their chance for a raise was crushed because they had no diploma.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after they worked hard to bring up the offspring, paid for its basic education and saw the child passing a university entrance examination, there was the reforms of the education system and the state-owned enterprises, college tuition went up and they lost their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="15"> as they got old day after day, illness and disease began to take a toll on their health.  unfortunately, this also coincided with the change and reform in the nation's healthcare system. this means: illness could not be treated since they could not afford to pay the medical and hospital bills.</seg>
<seg id="16"> it is obvious that a total lack of social justice ruthlessly descended on this generation.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but among people of this generation, not so many have joined the camp opposing maoism or attacking mao zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> they are not mao's slaves, but men of flesh and blood who constitute the real and living groups of humanity in our society. through their life of climbing the mountains and going to the countryside down to the loss of their jobs, these people lived and experienced in person our history and that is the social phenomenon of two historical eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> in spite of the school closing, the deplorable shortage of food and clothing and numerous other ills of the society in the mao zedong age, which aroused their grumbling and even hatred, they still consider the mao zedong years as good and as a time of high nationalism, superior ethical and moral life and of unsurpassed social environment and traditions.</seg>
<seg id="21"> parents of some of our friends on the internet belong to this age group.  you might do well to have a chat with them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "injection for watermelons," "cancerous bananas," and "cardboard-filled buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [barren plain beyond northern borders] [send text messages] and [table view] posted at 22:02:57 on july 19, 2007.  i remember a news item of the year before last reporting that chemicals were injected into hainan watermelons, resulting in the melons rotting on a massive scale in the fields and enormous losses to the melon growers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> later, cctv followed up with reports that thorough investigation proved there was absolutely no such a thing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> that report sounded strange in the first place. for injecting something into big watermelons one after another lacks any practical and meaningful justification. and, considering the amount of work, it would prove an impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="5"> memories of things happening last year are much clearer.  media reports said banana plants in hainan were infested with a disease similar to cancer that afflicts people. such diseased banana plants could hardly survive.</seg>
<seg id="6"> consequently, many people were misled to conclude that consuming bananas leads to cancer. the end result is the same: banana price collapsed; and, lamenting out loud, banana farmers cried and cried even after all tears were exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="7"> the reason that the two above reports were so sensational lies in the fact that they directly touched people's most sensitive nerve cords, namely, the issue of food safety.</seg>
<seg id="8"> if public media reported that certain foods are detrimental to health, the report is bound to spread far and wide from one person to ten and from ten to one hundred. as to the truth and substance of the report, people generally would rather take them seriously as credible than brush them aside as not trust-worthy. to one individual consumer, skipping a few hainan watermelons and/or bananas from his diet is, after all, only a bagatelle.  but to the grower and wholesaler of the produce, it is immeasurably important.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not long ago, a case of unsafe food exploded on the beijing media scene. as pork price increased steeply, some people used treated cardboard paper as filling to make steamed buns for sale. this was the so-called "buns of cardboard filling."</seg>
<seg id="10"> i was roundly shocked upon hearing this report. i felt that these small hawkers are too good at their r&d work that they devised such a method to cheat the consumers. furthermore, i spread the news far and wide and warned my families and friends not to buy steamed buns when they go on the street.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but yesterday, again reports suddenly sprang up to say that the story of "buns of cardboard filling" was a fake.  and the whole thing was fabricated by one person. thereupon i felt relieved and at ease. but, at the same time, i also began to wonder: what exactly is ailing our media today?</seg>
<seg id="12"> the true story i got from reliable sources runs like this: mr. zi, a temporary staff member on "transparency," a program on the lifestyle channel of the beijing television station, purchased ground meat filling, wheat flour and paper cartons on the market and arranged for some people, one of them named wei, to use the meat and the cardboard paper, after pulping the latter in water, to make steamed buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> zi stage-managed and filmed the bun-making process with digital video equipment he himself brought along, edited the film and got it on the tv program by hook or by crook.</seg>
<seg id="14"> now public security authorities have detained suspect zi, and will deal with him in a stern manner in accordance with the law.</seg>
<seg id="15"> after the cardboard bun story broke into the open, concerned and responsible offices and departments were immediately and rapidly organized by the government to look into the matter. a thoroughgoing and all-embracing inspection in the breakfast foods market in beijing was conducted in order to ensure the safety on the dining tables of the common folks.</seg>
<seg id="16"> after the truth behind the incident was firmly established, the beijing television station learned a deeply ingrained lesson and tendered open apologies to the public at large.  it also sternly investigated and dealt with the responsible people and will further improve management and control in order to stop up loopholes and block false, distorted and fabricated news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="17"> only, although the cardboard buns are proven to be non-existent, when public confidence will be restored so that people would again go to street stalls to buy steamed buns without fear remains a question mark.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the whole thing also shows, incidentally, that the government has assigned top priority and taken immediate and rapid action to solve problems related to food safety issues. it also demonstrated with considerable clarity that the dining tables in beijing homes are still relatively safe.  while the cardboard buns scare turned out to be a false alarm, it also could be considered a reminder and admonition to the public at large.</seg>

<seg id="1"> to whom should education be responsible?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> recently, i heard friends in china talk about what they sew at a school.  i cannot help speaking out about some of my concerns.</seg>
<seg id="3"> the incident occurred in a private high school in the city of shanghai, the southwest weiyu middle school.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the school decided to assign its best teachers to three classes  comprising students who signed a contract to move up inside southwest weiyu from middle school to high school. to other classes whose students consist of those transferred to weiyu from outside and/or those who signed no contract to move up inside weiyu, several young teachers whose pedagogic track record was not good and who had no experience teaching the third high school grade.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the reason is: those students who signed the agreement agreed to give up chances to take entrance examinations to other high schools, so best teachers should be given according to the assurances agreed and promised.</seg>
<seg id="6"> as to the students in several other classes, the school expressed this attitude: young teachers should be given opportunities to improve themselves through practice.</seg>
<seg id="7"> i just cannot help lamenting, to whom is education responsible?</seg>
<seg id="8"> i remember that many years ago, when i attended a key high school, our whole class, dissatisfied with the pedagogic performance of a math teacher, boldly, perhaps even recklessly, signed a joint petition, asking that the teacher be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="9"> afterwards, school authorities did replace the teacher. for the school promised that all individual students are considered equal and the school is responsible to every one of them.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ten years ago, i came to the united states to pursue post-graduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="11"> one year, in the summer, we were choosing what courses to take in the fall. i found that our department offered, in electives, all theoretical courses, but not one application-oriented practical course.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i went to talk to the department chair, telling him that there is a problem with the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the department chair admitted that the lack of application-oriented courses was due to insufficient faculty strength.  after a couple of years when there is available faculty, such courses may become available.</seg>
<seg id="14"> i remember telling him then: "this is your problem, not mine."</seg>
<seg id="15"> from shanghai, i traveled thousands of miles to come to study in your esteemed school, precisely because i was attracted by your brochure introducing me to the courses you offered.</seg>
<seg id="16"> if you were unable to offer these courses, then, refrain from putting them on the brochure.  otherwise, it would be false advertisement, not accountable to me and to my family.</seg>
<seg id="17"> having heard my opinion, the department chair thought for a while and said: "ok, let me see what we can do to solve the problem."</seg>
<seg id="18"> maybe it was too late, because all courses were already offered for online registration.</seg>
<seg id="19"> after three weeks, the department chair called me in for a talk, telling me mainly that his job was to assume responsibility to all and every student, including me.</seg>
<seg id="20"> he accepted my suggestion and did his best, that was to add two strongly application-oriented practical courses. he hoped that i could understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> after this happened, i took several courses taught by the department chair.</seg>
<seg id="22"> he never harbored any prejudice against me for the views i expressed.  in every course i took, he very impartially gave me an a.</seg>
<seg id="23"> before my graduation, i heard his secretary's remarks on how he did his very best for all his students, but not every one of them were grateful.</seg>
<seg id="24"> at the commencement ceremony, when speaking as the valedictorian, i told the department chair that every one thanks him from the bottom of our hearts for all he did to help us. for he did his best to assume responsibility to every one of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i felt that i made a correct choice of my life to come here and study.</seg>
<seg id="26"> when uttering these words, i saw tears the department chair tried to hide in his eyes.  one day, if every chinese educator and the whole education system dedicate themselves to be responsible to every student, i think, the real take-off point of the nation will not be too far ahead.</seg>

<seg id="1"> central ny men's 4s volleyball tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> last sunday, i took part in the men's 4s volleyball tournament in the central new york state. spending six and a half hours playing the matches, our team finally won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> this tournament, in fact, was organized as a training session to prepare for the volleyball tournament of the empire state games.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the coach broke up four men's teams (high school and college teams plus teams of 35-year-old-and-over as well as 45-year-old-and-over players) from the central regions of new york, then reorganized the players into teams of four members each. every team was assigned one middle blocker/setter to proceed with the matches.</seg>
<seg id="5"> the rules of the tournament were quite interesting. only players in the rear row were permitted to go on the offensive and the ball must not drop into the 3-meter zone.  only one player, the middle blocker, was allowed to go to the net to block the opponent's offensive.  no position rotation among a team's players was permitted.</seg>
<seg id="6"> hence, it was basically a test of the power of the offense and the positioning of the defense.</seg>
<seg id="7"> our team had a setter, who was two meters in height.  his attack was at once powerful and from a high vantage point. in the whole match, he was responsible for more than 60% of the offensive action and scoring.  we also had one 1.85-meter middle blocker who single-handedly frustrated many enemy offensive actions on the net,</seg>
<seg id="8"> and a 1.9-meter wing spiker who made many mistakes in his offensive action for he was positioned in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="9"> then there was me, a 1.75-meter ace spiker who often sneaked up for a surprise attack. my scoring ratio was fair.  i was mainly responsible for catching crosscourt smashes from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="10"> there were altogether seven teams.  they started with a round-robin in which our team won the first match.  then, the referee repeatedly called our foul for our setter's stepping on the line when staging an offensive.  our morale was thus greatly depressed, leading to the loss of three matches in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but after the loss, we all regained our poise and our coordination stabilized during these three matches. then, we began to win one match after another.</seg>
<seg id="12"> at the end of the round-robin, our team won three and lost three matches to rank ourselves a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="13"> following that, supplementary matches began.  without the top-ranking team, the second to seventh teams competed one against another in a game of elimination.</seg>
<seg id="14"> our team stayed calm and stable psychologically and in tactics. we worked hard to overwhelm our opponents and led the field in qualifying for the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> in the semi-final matches, the opponent has a strong offense and weak defense. they afflicted blue and purple bruises on my arms. but, once safely catching a hard spike, i got out of it a kick that was twice as satisfactory as my own successful offensive action.</seg>
<seg id="16"> we were not even aware of the final score when we won the game.</seg>
<seg id="17"> our opponent in the final match had a balanced offense-defense. we won many points by our serve and lead the game all the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> at the very end, we were comfortably leading with 21 to 24.  then, two powerful serves in a row by the opponent flew wild after i touched them. the score: 23 to 24.  the setter of our team ran over and told me: nothing to be concerned, it's only a couple of points.</seg>
<seg id="19"> then, another ball was flying in my direction. not too bad, i received it safe and sound. then, our middle blocker passed it backward to the setter to bring about a smashing spike and the battle was over.</seg>

<seg id="1"> again on morality</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> much has been said about morality as it bears on the free and unattached individual.</seg>
<seg id="3"> in this regard, i have nothing more to add.</seg>
<seg id="4"> now, i wish to address myself to the question of morality for the collective entity.</seg>
<seg id="5"> we often see the occasion when collective life and activities are essential.</seg>
<seg id="6"> on such an occasion, a collective body needs to maintain certain moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="7"> we can often find that collective entities which achieved success can boast of their virtues and morality.</seg>
<seg id="8"> that does not come about by chance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> for the causes or activities, one needs to overcome the difficulties confronting it, and its constituencies need to close ranks. i think, high moral strength, besides faith and creed, plays a vital role that cannot be neglected.</seg>
<seg id="10"> at the very least, we can safely predict that a group of people of low moral standards will not succeed in any worthy task.</seg>
<seg id="11"> this might because that, for a collective entity to achieve success, an essential quality is the wisdom that sees long-term interest through rational far-sightedness.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in fact, a collective entity often establishes its identity through a wide variety of ways such as logos, trade jargon, creed, and morality.</seg>
<seg id="13"> only by taking brandy in the morning and in the evening, can we see the ground blanketed by orchid flowers all along the road of life.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [discussion] up to now, how many times true happiness occurred?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> a very close high school friend of mine finally obtained a visa.  at the end of august she will be able to start her journey to pursue graduate studies in an extremely good college on the west coast of the united states.</seg>
<seg id="3"> today, several school friends had a small get-together.  all were so happy to see her dreams come true.</seg>
<seg id="4"> seeing her so happy, i felt really envious.</seg>
<seg id="5"> think of all the years up to the present, i was that happy only when i passed the entrance examination to high school.  up to that time, i never dreamed that i could succeed in the examination to enter the top or second ranking school in the entire city.  afterwards, between then and now came college and workplace which followed in due course and never gave me the same joy again.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the university i was admitted to was not the one i dreamed of entering.  hence, not much pleasure to speak of.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in the college years, all my hopes lie in the possibility of going north after graduation so that i could join my boyfriend, with whom i fell in love for two years then.</seg>
<seg id="8"> but fate plays games with you!  one month before my graduation, he asked that we go our separate ways. all the dreams i cherished up to that moment exploded like a bubble.</seg>
<seg id="9"> afterwards, i returned to the north to take a job. today, i have been on the job for two years and have built up enough savings to buy a medium-priced car. but throughout it all, i have not experienced again the happiness that once did descend on me.</seg>
<seg id="10"> today, when chatting with my good friend, i can understand and feel her happiness.  after struggling gallantly and working with a tremulous heart for one year to prepare herself, she finally goes abroad without a hitch to start a period of new life.  to experience a dream coming true really makes one happy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i have no plans to pursue further studies and do not like living in a foreign country. for i had worked for half a year abroad which led me to believe that living abroad does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> witness the happiness of a good friend cannot help leading me to think: what am i pursuing?</seg>
<seg id="13"> what will be able to make me experience, once again, the happiness of yore?</seg>
<seg id="14"> possibly, it is to find someone who truly likes me and wishes to live with me through the second half of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i think i will then cry out emotionally, just like what my good friend described to me of her uncontrollable burst into tears when she sailed through the embassy interview and received the approval notice.  one year of work and worries finally brought the reward.</seg>
<seg id="16"> but, what about me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> time and again i did my best to manage, with a tremulous heart, my emotional life.  when will i be rewarded with the realization of my dreams and cry out once to my heart's content and delight?</seg>
<seg id="18"> perhaps i do not have much ambition, for i never, from the beginning to the end, worry about my career. but, what about my emotional life?</seg>
<seg id="19"> when will i find an emotional home?</seg>
<seg id="20"> i am very distressed when dealing with this problem.</seg>
<seg id="21"> what about you, my brothers and sisters?</seg>
<seg id="22"> up to this moment, how many times have you encountered genuine happiness in your life?</seg>

<seg id="1"> promote architecture college of southeast university</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> ah, ah, count the following as my briefing for the southeast university alumni on the college of architecture of their university.</seg>
<seg id="3"> i am presenting the most recent first-hand information. authenticity is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="4"> dean wang, party secretary an, teacher li of the personnel office and other faculty members of the pedagogic and research section of architectural technology attended the briefing and reporting session. i talked for an hour followed by discussions by all participants for another one and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="5"> after the formal reporting session ended, teacher zhang (assistant to the dean) pulled me aside and asked me to a closed-door talk with him in an office to the rear of the compound.</seg>
<seg id="6"> very friendly and approachable he told me behind closed doors that some things could not be discussed at a formal meeting. he said it was obvious that i did not have any idea on my income here in the future. hence, he told me some concrete cases of earnings and income of faculty members of the college of architecture, to ease my anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="7"> before the formal reporting session, dean wang gave an introduction to the colleges of architecture. he said that only six important architecture disciplines were offered in all institutions throughout the country, namely, two in southeast university, two in tsinghua, one in tongji and one in tianjin university.  none is offered anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="8"> he said in recent years, energy saving of architectures, green architecture and architectural technology have gained special attention in the nation. southeast university wanted to bring in a faculty member specialized in these fields.</seg>
<seg id="9"> he said they received resumes from more than 20 applicants for this job. they were from domestic sources, japan and the united states (i was the sole applicant from the u.s., it seems).</seg>
<seg id="10"> the college of architecture considered the matter vital and conducted serious investigations on the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="11"> compared to the architecture colleges of other higher educational institutions that i know, southeast university certainly is a front runner.  while tongji university may be placed much higher than eastern in city planning, the latter is likely a bit better in architectural design. (i did not know that then.)</seg>
<seg id="12"> the college of architecture has been designated one of the colleges vital to the national 985 engineering construction plan.  in the past two years, it has been very well provided financially, said dean wang.</seg>
<seg id="13"> he told me that southeast university was allocated, at one throw, ten million yuan of development and construction financing last year.  of this amount, 3.5 million was to be used directly to replenish the specialist technological library of the college.  (wow, to this, i must sing a song of praise: what generosity!)</seg>
<seg id="14"> the remainder is nearly all used on installation and equipment of the specialist laboratory that i proposed.</seg>
<seg id="15"> it is said that to this project several academicians expressed variant views.</seg>
<seg id="16"> ha, ha -- while on the subject, i might as well say that i think they paid too much for some imported equipments.</seg>
<seg id="17"> one set of equipment to conduct experiments to measure air-tightness of a room is widely used in the united states where its cost is definitely below 500 us dollars. southeast university finally spent rmb 50,000 to acquire it.</seg>
<seg id="18"> there are yet other situations worth reporting, many departments and colleges of the southeast university have moved to the new campus in jiulonghu. but the college of architecture has made a firm decision to stay put, professing that its student should remain in a superior architectural environment. there are still some architectural classics on the old campus grounds, while the new campus is completely barren of them.</seg>
<seg id="19"> ha ha - it seems that since other departments have moved away, the college of architecture requisitioned an additional building.</seg>
<seg id="20"> hence, dean wang told me right off that an exclusive office could be assigned me later on.</seg>
<seg id="21"> it caused me some embarrassment later for this offer made by dean wang did not arouse any emotional reaction in me when it was received.</seg>
<seg id="22"> afterwards, i was told by teacher zhang, who pulled me aside, that this offer did not come easy. for office space was in real short supply and some senior professors had not been assigned their own yet.</seg>
<seg id="23"> this made me extremely uneasy.  it seemed that i had very little idea of the background of the situation in this country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> all in all, this trip to southeast university is very pleasant for me. i am highly and favorably impressed by the dedication, enthusiasm and friendship of the leadership and responsible faculty members of the college of architecture of the university.</seg>
<seg id="25"> i wish southeast university will sail smoothly and rapidly forward on the road of development, and its college of architecture will maintain a good lead ahead of its sister institutions!</seg>

<seg id="2"> taking care of sick children</seg>
<seg id="3"> showing "muscles of mice"</seg>
<seg id="4"> after congo, sun yanzi joined the world outlook conference for the second time to travel to niger, africa.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at a press conference yesterday, she admitted frankly that it was the most exhausting trip she had ever undertaken in her life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the local weather was extremely hot and the drinking water was muddy.  when visiting the city market she was met by crowds throwing stones in protest.  even when she rode a camel its saddle chair left a scratch wound on her.</seg>
<seg id="7"> dozens of incidents happened along the way, causing her to cry out loud repeatedly in her mind: "how i wish to go back home!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> she was shocked seeing malnutrition in children.</seg>
<seg id="9"> having joined the "care for the impoverished children" campaign of the world outlook conference three years in a row, sun yanzi calls herself a senior spokesperson of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10"> she has brought along 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 flashlights and 500 pieces of candy to share with the local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> she said, accumulated experiences told her no matter what quantities of small gifts one brings along they will never prove to be enough.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the most serious problem encountered in niger is that the mothers there know absolutely nothing about bringing up their children and the children suffer from serious malnutrition problems.</seg>
<seg id="13"> when on an 8-hour, 500-kilometer journey from the capital city of niger to the small town of tawa, sun yanzi experienced a sandstorm which is rare in that area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> stormy winds carried sand mixed with rain water.  the entire sky changed color with the turbulence of the storm.</seg>
<seg id="15"> the jeep she was riding in swung wildly with the winds.</seg>
<seg id="16"> recalling that time, sun yanzi is still trembling with fear left over from that day.  though she was inside the car, she still could not help feeling scared.</seg>
<seg id="17"> afterwards, only when she heard indigenous folks say that sandstorms symbolize good fortune, she felt somewhat relieved.</seg>
<seg id="18"> together with local people</seg>
<seg id="19"> lamenting difficulties plaguing local mothers in rearing children</seg>
<seg id="20"> upon her arrival in tawa, local officials staged a welcome ceremony which featured single hump camels. sun yanzi was invited to mount a camel to acknowledge the loud applause and salute of the local welcoming crowds.</seg>
<seg id="21"> but the camel, scared by photographers' flashes, went out of control.  sun yanzi was almost thrown down to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="22"> finally, she herself dismounted. but her dress was caught and torn by the saddle, leaving a bloodied scratch of some 8 centimeters on her back.</seg>
<seg id="23"> on this visit, sun yanzi visited four sick local children who suffered from serious malnutrition.  one of them was a baby four months of age weighing only 2.1 kilograms.  it did not look like a human baby at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> sun said: "my heart aches when i saw the baby whose condition was really grotesque. but the mother should be responsible. mothers there should be taught the right ideas and ways of nutrition for their children."</seg>

<seg id="3"> the purpose of education is: to make the educated capable of existing  and of enjoying themselves in the present social environment with greater ease.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "existing" -- this is a concept easily understood by all. as to "enjoyment," people perhaps understand it to be simply "play and entertainment."  in fact, it is not so.  "enjoyment" signifies many categories of concepts and events.</seg>
<seg id="5"> "existing" includes growth and strengthening of physical and mental capabilities.</seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. growth and strengthening of one's physical capabilities -- through sports, one can enhance physical power, ability of coordination, and constantly improve mobility to satisfy one's own need of moving about as well as the social need of dealing with the society.</seg>
<seg id="7"> 2. growth and strengthening of one's mental capabilities -- one can achieve clearer understanding of the society one lives in, as well as knowledge of the self. one learns to master ways of dealing with other people, and  acquires the skills of adapting to one's existence, and of enjoying life.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the above is a discussion of the purpose of education which does not really bear on the theme of this writing.  now, let's talk about the point of emphasis: key to education in china -- humanistic orientation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> human nature means: one should fully understand that each individual differs with the other. none should be viewed and treated in the same way as stereotypes.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [original article of the club]: usual stages of learning buffett</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> original article of the club: usual stages of learning buffett</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) the first stage: first contact with buffett rewards one with the feeling of pocketing a sovereign treasure. immediate application of what one learned follows. however, at this point of time, superficial and half-baked knowledge frequently leads to wrong approaches, incorrect application and blind alleys. good harvest may appear today and disappear tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) the second stage: a "breakthrough" of buffett theory. after a period of intensive study, both in theory and in practice, almost every "wise man" would try to puzzle out a number of questions, such as "what is a buffett of special chinese characteristics?"</seg>
<seg id="5"> or "do we have to be flexible in applying the buffett theory in china?"</seg>
<seg id="6"> or "can we do better than buffett can?"</seg>
<seg id="7"> thus, during this stage of learning, the student is mainly affected by a blind megalomania in a search for a buffett theory with a china bent.</seg>
<seg id="8"> after a period of practice in the real world, success still often proves to be an elusive matter, void of consistency and continuity. if one is lucky, he would do his best to take some losses and reverse his course as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) the third stage: returning to buffett.  after turning things upside down a number of times, one finally realizes that one is only an ordinary person instead of a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> one should lower expectations of oneself.  modestly, one should be satisfied completely with just learning from buffett.</seg>
<seg id="11"> contrary to common belief, the simplest is the most useful and most effective.  but simple methods usually are based on extremely profound theories.  understanding such profound theories must precede better and full prosecution of the simple methods.</seg>
<seg id="12"> what this stage brings forward is: modest success in the short term, but plenty of long-term rewards and continuity.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4) the fourth stage: "stubborn" buffett.  after tasting continuity of successes, one becomes basically a stubborn hard-line believer in buffett theories.  one would not honor a company that is not of the buffett mould even with a condescending glance.</seg>
<seg id="14"> one studies buffett theories incessantly to enhance one's understanding and apply them in practice. one's performance in this stage would bring ever better results, and usher one into a cycle of positives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> how long each stage lasts would depend on the nature and condition of the individual and his or her luck and fortune.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> he is my online friend of long standing.  he posted the following story in the newsgroup.</seg>
<seg id="3"> i would rather write the story in this column.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i hope you all can read the article, though i do not expect it to become a so-called recommended article. nevertheless, i believe some things and truths can often be better grasped by way of a small but tightly organized story.</seg>
<seg id="5"> this is a story that makes the readers feel as if a chill is running through the heart.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i really wish that it were only a story, for such a real-world event would make one feel very sad and distressed.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on a highway running through mountainous terrain, three gun-wielding bandits, having spotted a pretty woman driver on a medium-sized bus, forced the vehicle to a stop, and invited the driver off the bus for a little stroll.  in despair, she called out for help. but all the passengers responded with utter silence.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the only prompt response came from a middle-aged man of flimsy build. he was, however, knocked down to the floor, wounded.</seg>
<seg id="9"> trembling in anger, he tried hard, rose again and shouted for help from all the fellow passengers. however, none responded. that allowed the bandits to drag the woman driver away to the bushes in the forest.</seg>
<seg id="10"> an hour later, the three bandits came back to the bus along with the driver, whose clothing was badly rumbled and torn.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the bus was to be under way again.  the woman driver asked the skinny and bleeding man who was beaten up to get off the bus.</seg>
<seg id="12"> he refused and things got into a deadlock.</seg>
<seg id="13"> hey, get off the bus. my bus will not carry you.</seg>
<seg id="14"> the middle-aged man fumed: you are out of your senses.  did i do something wrong in trying to help you?</seg>
<seg id="15"> you? trying to help me?</seg>
<seg id="16"> what help have you given?</seg>
<seg id="17"> the woman driver's persistent denials caused some of the fellow passengers to giggle, quite inaudibly.</seg>
<seg id="18"> the middle-aged man was furious. he hated himself for not possessing the prowess of a robin hood.</seg>
<seg id="19"> even if i failed to save people out of dangerous straits, do i deserve to be shooed out of the bus?  he firmly refused to evacuate.</seg>
<seg id="20"> besides, i paid the fare and have the right to ride in the bus!</seg>
<seg id="21"> the driver raised her sight, looking skyward, and said without mercy: if you do not get off, i am not going to drive.</seg>
<seg id="22"> quite unexpectedly, the fellow passengers who closed their eyes when witnessing the brutal crime just a while earlier, were now suddenly awakened. they tried as one to persuade the middle-aged man to leave the bus. get off real quick. we still have our business to do, and cannot afford the delay!</seg>
<seg id="23"> several strong passengers even wanted to pull the middle-aged man off the bus. that reminds one of scenes in "boule de suif" by maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> the three bandits grinned smugly.</seg>
<seg id="25"> of the three, a dark-skinned one shamelessly said: we made her reckless!</seg>
<seg id="26"> the other two also were delirious: she is mine, she is none of your business!</seg>
<seg id="27"> a fight and pushing followed until the skinny man's baggage was thrown out of the window and he himself was shoved out of the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="28"> the bus was again under way on the highway in the mountains.  the female driver pushed back her hair and turned the radio-recorder on.</seg>
<seg id="29"> the bus was approaching the summit. after negotiating a turn, the driver saw the slope downward looming large ahead. on the left was mountain side, to the right was a steep cliff hundreds of meters deep.</seg>
<seg id="30"> quietly and imperceptibly, the vehicle picked up speed.  facial expression of the woman driver was perfectly calm.  her two hands gripped the steering wheel firmly.  gleaming tears were streaming down her cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> one bandit seemed to have sensed something wrong. he said, drive slowly! slow down! god damn it! what are you trying to do?</seg>
<seg id="32"> the woman driver said nothing. the bus continued to go faster and faster.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the bandit tried to dash forward to grab the steering wheel. but the bus was shooting off the cliff like an arrow released from the bow.</seg>
<seg id="34"> on the next day, local newspapers reported a tragedy that happened yesterday in the mount fuhu area: a medium-sized bus plunged down the high cliffs.</seg>
<seg id="35"> of all 14 persons on board -- the driver and 13 passengers -- none survived the accident.</seg>
<seg id="36"> upon reading the report, the middle-aged man who was forced out of the bus mid-way in the journey, cried out.</seg>

<seg id="1"> darkness in railway station</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> i have been traveling by train out of town in the recent days and have discovered how "black" the railroad stations in various places are!</seg>
<seg id="3"> i want to find out what precautions one should take in rail stations in various localities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i'm from changsha, and let me start with a description of the ins and outs of changsha. pay attention if you're going to changsha!</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. train tickets always in short supply: especially in the long holidays, and on dates associated with the start and end of summer and winter vacations or opening and closure of school semesters, the scarcity is absolute. no matter how early you go to line up at the ticket counter, your efforts and sacrifices would prove to be in vain.</seg>
<seg id="6"> the most water-tight answer i can find is: all tickets have been reserved for and by travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> but, from the ticket scalpers, you can get as many as you want at a premium.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. watch out for forgeries: even the supply by the scalpers is not always the genuine article. in hunan, a man becomes rich by forging official certificates and licenses in shuangfeng, and another fellow by counterfeiting banknotes and coins in xinhua. hence, producing forged tickets is merely child's play.</seg>
<seg id="9"> forgery by way of cutting and patching up is of the crudest sort. some forged tickets look so authentic and even the train staff cannot identify them!</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. who touched my banknote:  be very careful when shopping at the stores in the rail station.</seg>
<seg id="11"> if you wish to make a payment in small-change banknotes, ah, ah, you always find their corners torn off. consequently, you are more or less forced to convert them into notes of large denominations.</seg>
<seg id="12"> but, when you pay with a big note, the store proprietor would definitely say that he does not have enough change for you. giving "your" note back, he, then, still asks for small notes of torn corners. then, you have no alternative but take back the counterfeit note of a large denomination.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. black magician and small change:  not every store owner gives back "your" note which he has substituted with a counterfeit. that is a serious felony involving relatively greater risks.</seg>
<seg id="14"> hence some "timid" store owners can only play the role of the black magician. you clearly see him counting out the correct change. but when you have a chance to do the counting yourself, ah, ah, you would find that a few notes are missing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. the place is awash with imported wine and liquor.  in the tearoom of the railroad station, they do not seem to be in excessive quantity.  but you'll find out soon enough when you walk in.</seg>
<seg id="16"> a couple glasses of inferior red wine can be sold at prices rivaling that of martell cognac.  if you refuse to pay, you may leave the place and find that your mother no longer recognizes who you are.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. roses and fire arms: in the vicinity of the rail station, there are numerous video parlors which screen programs whose titles still have enormous attraction over us, the vulgar male viewers. if you step in to take a look, you will surely be taken as an honor guest seeking rest and recreation. consequently, a rose mm appears in an instant to keep you company. naturally, prices are comparable with that of 5-star hotels.  otherwise, you will see that swords are not always used on the enemy!</seg>
<seg id="18"> 7. ice and fire: if you have a changsha accent or know the city well, you will never be able to get a taxi in front of the rail station.  the facial expressions of the taxi drivers will acquaint you with what is called "frost in june."</seg>
<seg id="19"> but, if you are a first-time visitor in changsha, congratulations to you.  even if the place you want to go to is only five minutes away on foot, the driver will be extra warm and solicitous in showing you the pre-eminent sceneries of this nationally designated tourism city, and to offer you, in "second-hand" fashion, a puff of the famous white sand brand cigarettes or the characteristic local smell of betel-nuts.</seg>
<seg id="20"> of course, you'd have to pay the taxi out of your own pocket.  wouldn't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> nanjing underground train driver should receive psycho treatment soonest</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key term: psychotherapeutic readjustment</seg>
<seg id="3"> according to xinhua news agency, a man lying on the tracks of the nanjing underground was killed in the evening of july 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> the reporter said: "zhu zhengting, 22 years old, a young underground train driver, lived through a nightmare. when your reporter met him yesterday, zhu did not seem to have regained his composure after being wrecked by the horrifying experience. sitting on a chair, he stared straight forward, betraying signs of dementia.</seg>
<seg id="5"> obviously, the young driver was psychologically devastated and in urgent need of immediate psychotherapeutic treatment. without such treatment, he could expect permanent damage and life-long suffering.</seg>
<seg id="6"> i don't know if all could remember that more than 10 years ago, a man  rescued a little girl from an abandoned oil well in texas, usa. he underwent psychotherapy for a long period of time.  but still he finally chose suicide to end his life of miseries.</seg>
<seg id="7"> at the time, he was given simple psychotherapeutic treatment. but since attention was mostly on the rescued little girl, the very person who needed even more psychotherapeutic attention was neglected.  finally, tragic consequences became inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="8"> similarly, in a smuggling case across the strait of dover several years ago, the first british policeman to open the suspect container, was reported to have blacked out right on the scene.</seg>
<seg id="9"> later, british authorities gave him psychotherapeutic treatment for more than two months before he regained normal psychological equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="10"> draconian trauma caused by disasters often leaves behind severe psychological damage which can not be repaired by the individual victim alone. such damage often would leave behind a psychological scar.</seg>
<seg id="11"> such scars are hardly ever discernible to an outsider. and, even if discovered and identified, they often defy remedies and therapeutic treatment. hence, many such victims are left in life-long misery and suffering.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, in our country people show little care and concern over the suffering and victims of psychological trauma. this is especially true when we talk about family members and/or bosses and superior officers of the victims.  they often let the most crucial moments and the most opportune period for rehabilitation slip away. then, they suddenly think about the matter only when it has become too late.</seg>
<seg id="13"> now, since public media have diversified, we often hear a lot of such sensational reports as: many young and/or adolescent girls are abused and injured and many children witness their parents subjected to inhuman cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after these children and teenagers are rescued, it is rarely reported that they have been given psychotherapeutic treatment.  most of them are consoled by their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> even if the victims now feel safe, their wounds eventually become scars of unrelieved pain and horror that are awakened frequently to haunt them and poison their life and behavior all the time.</seg>
<seg id="16"> fortunately, his superiors gave the underground train driver timely help and consolation on the spot to effectively relieve and ameliorate his pressure and strains.</seg>
<seg id="17"> after all, the driver was neither at fault nor responsible at al for the accident.  he also took all needed emergency measures after discovering the dangers.  although he could not and did not forestall the tragic accident, he did all that could have been done.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i believe, even if another eye-witness, instead of this driver, were present at the scene, he or she, likewise, would have been rudely shocked by the accident.</seg>
<seg id="19"> but other people are not involved in or responsible for the behavior of the man committing suicide.  even if they were shocked and frightened, the shock will be gradually forgotten with the passage of time.</seg>
<seg id="20"> the driver, as someone directly involved, could not have things so easy.  he consciously and subconsciously commits the horror scene to memory, possibly for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> if he could be released from memories of this tragedy, that is lucky riddance of the hurtful images.  if not, horror will keep on haunting him forever.</seg>
<seg id="22"> the modern concept of good health embraces all aspects of a person's well being.  mental health is beginning to get more attention.</seg>
<seg id="23"> it is regrettable that mental conditions of mankind in general are deplorable, particularly in urban areas.  mental health of the human population is far from ideal.  the majority more or less has been threatened by potential mental disorders.  and others, already confronted with psycho problems, cannot stir up sufficient sympathy and concern in the mind of the public.</seg>
<seg id="24"> just think of the lessons learned in the "yang lijuan incident" a while back.  some irresponsible media, in order to arouse public interest and attention, made a target and a sacrificial lamb of a mental patient in deep psychological strain and misery.  that exerts very bad influence on the society.</seg>
<seg id="25"> we must try to prevent this sort of incident from rearing its head.  otherwise, our society will become a sick society.</seg>

<seg id="1"> emerging from first round of new curricula training five dongkou fifth high teachers have much to say</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key terms: dongkou fifth high school, first group of teacher-trainees, training course for new curricula. as members of the first group taking the training course for the new curricula, five dongkou fifth high school teachers made a lot of comments.  from morning hours of july 13 to july 15, the first group of five dongkou fifth high teachers to take the training courses on the new curricula, felt the palpable pressures and driving force of the curricula.</seg>
<seg id="3"> meanwhile, they also thought that new curricula reforms constitute a rare opportunity in and a challenge to the development of pedagogic work in schools.</seg>
<seg id="4"> in the morning of the 13th, several teachers of the dongkou fifth high and teachers from suining and other places were underway. but delayed by traffic jams caused by road-building work in the shijiang-longhui section of the highway, we arrived at the municipal education bureau late, in fact, long after 1:00 p.m.  the bureau's staff members kept working way beyond the end of the day's shift, retrieved the materials they already loaded in a truck, did all needed paper work and distributed training materials to us.</seg>
<seg id="5"> at 2:30 p.m. the road-weary teachers again braved scorching heat to move on to the municipal first, municipal second and municipal sixth high schools to take part in multi-media seminars conducted by experts in various fields.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in the following two days, the teachers heard lectures either by authors and compilers of teaching materials, or by teachers from other provinces where new curricula reforms have been put into practice. the latter group talked about  their new experience and discoveries.  some teachers and researchers of our province who went through similar training courses also shared their knowledge with us.</seg>
<seg id="7"> after all training courses were concluded in the morning of the 15th, tests and evaluation were also conducted.  the five teachers from the dongkou fifth high passed these tests without a hitch and received end-of-course certificates. for they all studied earnestly and never were too late in arriving or too early in quitting individual training sessions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the period of the training sessions, teachers from the dongkou fifth high exchanged views among themselves.  not familiar with the new curricula in the beginning, all of them felt that assignments were burdensome and pressures, heavy.  they were not sure of themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> but after the training sessions were over, all pronounced the whole episode a worthy opportunity and challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> and all pledged their best effort to restructure the educational and knowledge system and to push forward the curricula reformation program to a satisfactory conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the second group of teacher-trainees to join the new curricula training program have already arrived in the relevant destinations on the 16th to take up the training courses.</seg>

<seg id="1"> glad to befriend fans of stars xxx</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key terms: fans of the stars</seg>
<seg id="3"> i have a female friend whom i never met face-to-face.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i told her directly: i admire you very much.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for you express your love very directly</seg>
<seg id="6"> she likes a popular male host on an entertainment show in taiwan and never tries to cover it up at all.</seg>
<seg id="7"> when this male host went to jinan to host a popular program, she flew to jinan; when he went to changsha as a guest performer she winged there.</seg>
<seg id="8"> in a book he wrote, the male host said a friend sent him a slingshot sans missiles as a gift.  she was surprised and told me that this slingshot was a gift "i presented to him."</seg>
<seg id="9"> she also joined a team to put out an electronic magazine centered around this star.  joined by me, she enjoyed viewing every issue of it in great excitement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i always like to make friends with people who frankly admit that they are fans of one star or another.</seg>
<seg id="11"> the stars could be a television celebrity, a popular ball player, or, of course, towering figures in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="12"> i never consider these friends shallow.  i think they are lovable.</seg>
<seg id="13"> generally, they are honest and straightforward.  if they like a person, they say so outright.  if they dislike one, they also admit it.</seg>
<seg id="14"> dealing with this type of people put you at ease.</seg>
<seg id="15"> although they might not take your feelings one hundred percent into consideration.  but at least you know well what and how they feel, be it joy, anger, sadness or merriment.  you enjoy a sense of greater security when dealing with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> these people are very frank and honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> you should realize that dare to express one's likes and dislikes also takes courage.</seg>
<seg id="18"> because of a lack of such courage, many people like another person all through their life but remain silent about it.  they might even look down on those who openly announce that they are fans of so and so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i think, being frank is one of the most admired virtues of a person -- frank to one's friends and frank to oneself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> but to be truly frank is, in fact, very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="21"> if one is able to like a star, at least it proves that one has a unselfish streak in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="22"> some of my friends are fans of one star or another.</seg>
<seg id="23"> to set eyes on this very star, they do not mind suffer inconveniences, miseries and even a great sacrifice.  they could go without meals or live a thrift life.  they could also hold big posters with the left hand, manipulate a camera in the right hand and, at the same time, shouting at the top of their voice.</seg>
<seg id="24"> you may call them foolish or childish, but they need to be selfless so that they can love without expecting any compensation,</seg>
<seg id="25"> since in the real world too many people love only themselves, always consider themselves to be in the right and never say a good word for another person, this selflessness appears all the more rare and precious.</seg>
<seg id="26"> therefore, when people get together to discuss which stars are their idol, and one of the people present would say that "i worship nobody,"</seg>
<seg id="27"> then, ha, ha, better be careful and on your guard.</seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> about zhang xiaohui</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key term:  zhang xiaohui</seg>
<seg id="3"> by chance i saw one show of the serial, "emperor kangxi comes," which i have not been watching for a long time.  its leading star is zhang xiaohui.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i think it was around the time when "peach color" was being promoted.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i saw "peach color" when i was crazy about films of passion.</seg>
<seg id="6"> at that time, i really felt it odd that films of lust could be so aesthetic, and sometimes also quite interesting.  it is called films of passion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> actually i have not seen too many of these films, but those i did see were filmed in quite a number of countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> my earliest contacts were with films from korea and japan;</seg>
<seg id="9"> then, also many from third-world countries, and latin american and european countries. but, on the other hand, i have not seen too many from hollywood or from france.</seg>
<seg id="10"> of them, two films were so worthy that i could not afford to delete.  one was "adolescence" and the other "peach color."</seg>
<seg id="11"> the first half of "peach color" was quite good.  all hands were new and all worked hard. the director also knew how far to go and when to stop.</seg>
<seg id="12"> the second half was, however, somewhat abnormal.  i could not accept it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> in fact, what i want to say is: zhang xiaohui said on the program that her boy friends came from nearly all countries of the world except countries in africa.</seg>
<seg id="14"> at the time, she had four boy friends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> this is something, i am afraid, people generally cannot accept. they would say that this person is too licentious.</seg>
<seg id="16"> but the key of the issue is: she was perfectly sincere and honest when uttering these words, leaving not an iota of bad taste or awkwardness in the listener.</seg>
<seg id="17"> she also talked about her own view and position on love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> for example: the other party must be financially independent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> i guess, she meant, independent also in personality and be able to control one's own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="20"> for i know that a person in love sees love as something on the move and something selfish. how can one permit the person one loves accept love from anybody else!</seg>
<seg id="21"> according to my experience, knowledge and forecast, zhang xiaohui is not experiencing simple emotional attachment, but, decidedly, typical affections between an elder sister and a younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="22"> in elder sister-kid brother love, the sister can be extremely tolerant and broad-minded. for example, the sister has several brothers all at the same time.  meanwhile, the brother can love the sister insatiably because of her attraction and her motherliness, and do not mind such things as exclusiveness.</seg>
<seg id="23"> on the other hand, i also find in the remarks of zhang xiaohui that she, in fact, understands well how to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="24"> for instance, she loves travel to a fault.</seg>
<seg id="25"> hence, i also have a reason to believe that her life is excellent and wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="26"> but before i am really so convinced, i might not be able to accept these things and happenings.</seg>
<seg id="27"> just examine my case.  i have also accepted many people, without, in fact, being prejudiced by broad-mindedness or narrow-mindedness.  once you see through the mist and fog, you know that love and hate are anything but absolute.</seg>
<seg id="28"> these people could be passer-by a, friend b, miss zhang ziyi, good friend c, or sister hibiscus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> looking at the life of others, you are no more than an onlooker. to an onlooker, aren't you the master of your own life?</seg>
<seg id="30"> this is like the situation that legends about myself have always been found in the jiangnan region, even if i have not been there myself.</seg>

<seg id="1"> men need spirit of fun</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key term: spirit of fun</seg>
<seg id="3"> for a man, life is very hard and burdensome.  hence, he needs to have some fun.</seg>
<seg id="4"> you either laugh at yourself, watch others making a fool of themselves, or gossip about other people.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for example, you should go to "the end of the world (tianya)," to take a look at the "gossip for fun" for a bit of relaxation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> in it, everybody has his say.  naturally, as different shades of blackness in gossips are mongered endlessly, you should be able to distinguish truth from falsehood and the right from the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="7"> speak out whenever you wish.  and you end up not knowing what you are talking about. but, you have to understand what are you seeing and reading.</seg>
<seg id="8"> little s calls cai kang an intellectual, or one of the "people who read books."</seg>
<seg id="9"> if i can also be counted in this group, then i belong to those people who read a few books, but do not fully understand what they have read.</seg>
<seg id="10"> luckily, i always know myself.</seg>
<seg id="11"> but, after all, i got what i wished to get when i read those few books.</seg>
<seg id="12"> and coincidentally, i like to think and let my thoughts run wild. i read when i think at the same time.  this enables me to see the meaning of things clearly all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="13"> consequently, some good habits and attitudes are formed.  for instance, i often tell myself to be more strict and demanding on my self, but be kind to others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> whenever problems or difficulties arise, first look inward for the cause and put the blame on myself.</seg>
<seg id="15"> handle the business side rationally, but handle emotions, friendship  and feelings with empathy.</seg>
<seg id="16"> behave and deal with fellow men in a low key. execute businesses also in a low key.</seg>
<seg id="17"> but you know, people are not that good and usually tend to be selfish and calculating in matters of gain and loss. oftentimes they are hopelessly emotional and sentimental just when the need of the hour is rationality.  and when they should use their heart and feelings, they often become god-damned rational.</seg>
<seg id="18"> but, the good thing about it is: one would not think of regretting the choices one makes.</seg>
<seg id="19"> when it is done, it is done. when you fall on your face, resign yourself to the mishap.</seg>
<seg id="20"> why should you chew the nonsense over and again in your mind?</seg>
<seg id="21"> not too bad, i am not a dour fellow who always try to show myself as a superior intellectual. i am just an ordinary and unrefined commoner.</seg>
<seg id="22"> only a difference between me and some of my fellow men lies in the fact that i need not act as a cynic or a misanthrope.  i treat everything and all situations rationally.</seg>
<seg id="23"> and, perhaps, another example of the difference lies in my strong faith and profound convictions.</seg>
<seg id="24"> once i trust a person, then, i believe everything he or she does is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> even if there are inadequacies in him or in her, i would be willing and glad to accept and tolerate them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> even if i am not of the type that is chummy with friends who frequently get together in a lively and rousing way, i can be classified as one who always has his friends' interest on his mind.</seg>
<seg id="27"> but, as this is the case, i guard myself rather carefully against bad company.</seg>
<seg id="28"> also, i could not understand at all why there are still so many people who believe what is said and acted upon in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="29"> perhaps, in their mind news reports of today still have that quality of sacredness as they had in the olden days.</seg>
<seg id="30"> however, in this world, there are so many things that i cannot understand.</seg>
<seg id="31"> it's a joke!</seg>
<seg id="32"> i slap myself on the face.</seg>

<seg id="1"> song dandan "depth of happiness," warm and touching</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key terms: song dandan, depth of happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> sometime ago, i read a newspaper report about a newly published book by song dandan entitled "depth of happiness."</seg>
<seg id="4"> i was quite keen on reading it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> for i wish to know what views she -- as a woman of her age and profession, and having gone through unusual changes in family and career life -- has on herself and on life itself.</seg>
<seg id="6"> as expected, the book did not disappoint me at all. going over it i was struck by two things.  first, the book thrilled and electrified me.  in the life of other people, i saw also my own shadow and image.  secondly, i was deeply touched by detailed descriptions of affectionate life of the family.</seg>
<seg id="7"> why was i electrified?</seg>
<seg id="8"> in the book song dandan wrote: "i neglected an important principle of life: to give is more fortunate than to receive.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i have always been busy giving, busy in making myself fortunate.</seg>
<seg id="10"> i don't want to receive and understand little of receiving.  i neglect giving others the opportunity to give, that is neglecting the rights of others to be fortunate.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i discovered that i myself also have enjoyed such good fortune all the time.  from here on, perhaps i should be more thoughtful in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="12"> if one can face his/her own past with openness and honesty, and bare all and everything before the public, that would have called for considerable courage.</seg>
<seg id="13"> in her book she wrote about, among other things, her first love, her collapsed marriage with yingda, penetrating analysis of herself as well as the affections between herself and her son</seg>
<seg id="14"> there is another matter related to this book which is worthy of praise. in the beginning, the publisher must have strongly urged her to lay greater emphasis on "i love my sweet home," and "lay ambush in ten directions" as well as a series of short essays on zhao benshan.</seg>
<seg id="15"> but, i think she must have held firm to her principles.  only casual mention of zhao benshan appeared at the end. as to "ambush" and "i love my home," both were hardly touched on.</seg>
<seg id="16"> throughout the entire book, the reader finds brimful of descriptions of how a 40-year-old woman understands and feels about her own life, love, family and kinship affections. it is warm and touching.</seg>

<seg id="1"> busy vacation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key terms: vacation, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> vacation started a week ago.  but since then, there has not been one idle moment either.</seg>
<seg id="4"> i took part in a conference at the academy. then, i also must gather needed materials for a meeting next week, including drafting a paper to be delivered on that occasion.</seg>
<seg id="5"> i will be very busy in this vacation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> provided that nothing goes out of control, my plans call for the attendance of three conferences and visits to four or five cities.</seg>
<seg id="7"> life is fully packed with much content. some items are similar to each other, others are of various types.  i almost forgot how vacations in past years were spent.</seg>
<seg id="8"> my memories seem to indicate that earlier vacations also were not all spent in idleness.</seg>
<seg id="9"> only, in earlier vacations i was in control over the use of long periods of free time.  but this year such time has been much curtailed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> is it a good or a bad thing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> busy times generally make for a fuller life.  but getting busy for nothing or only for a meager harvest, imposes a discount on the value of the packed work schedules.</seg>
<seg id="12"> however, it seems that there are times when life cannot be evaluated entirely on the criteria of effect produced. life is to be slowly experienced. to walk on solid ground, to ensure safety and stability in life, and to live fully and pleasantly constitute one sort of worthy accomplishment, even though they cannot be expressed on a scale of social benefits.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the worth of every individual is assessed on a scale of social value and on a scale of personal value.  if one is to be assessed only on one but not on both scales, what should we do?</seg>
<seg id="14"> marxism tells us that the scale of social value should be the top choice, for marxism advocates contributions by the individual to the society. in reality, however, a healthy and sound society also should fully respect the wishes and values of the individual, and should even create favorable conditions for the realization of personal values.</seg>
<seg id="15"> this question suddenly caught my interest and attention. more and more clearly i found that marxist principles really are effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> these principles are indeed valid.  but in real life, people sometimes cannot help getting confused.</seg>
<seg id="17"> even if realization of personal values does not infringe on the realization of social values, would every individual in the real world be satisfied with the realization of himself?  and would he ignore or even set social values aside?</seg>
<seg id="18"> or, can the satisfaction of realizing one's personal values be divorced from social values assessment?</seg>
<seg id="19"> that is very difficult, it seems.</seg>
<seg id="20"> consequently, after working hard to live a good ordinary life, every one of us cannot help pursuing excellence and the extraordinary.  failing that, we would blame ourselves for wasting our life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> probably, this is one facet of the social man.</seg>
<seg id="22"> now the vacation has begun, the days do become more or less relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="23"> at least, i have time to watch an occasional video show, or relax and play a while,</seg>
<seg id="24"> and chat a little.   there's still work to be done, and a life to live.</seg>
<seg id="25"> next week, i have to go away again, to a conference in xi-an.</seg>
<seg id="26"> although i have never visited xi-an, the city is not much to my liking, because of some prejudices i have picked up.</seg>
<seg id="27"> i hope this forthcoming trip could change my impressions of this city.  ho, ho!</seg>

<seg id="1"> "highly feministic life"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key terms: men, feminism era</seg>
<seg id="3"> in the afternoon ying phoned. we talked for a while and brought up me watching "pleasant male voice."</seg>
<seg id="4"> ying said: "it couldn't be true! you are too cute!  super female voice followed by pleasant male voice, you are a real loyal audience of the hunan satellite television."</seg>
<seg id="5"> i admitted that she was right.</seg>
<seg id="6"> ying said she watched some talent hunt programs featuring male performers. she considers them bunch of feminine males. i agree with her, but told her that "pleasant male voice" has reached a 5-rising-to-4 rating and would score 4-rising-to-3 next week.  the vocals were really good.  every one tumbled over the other in their climb to the summit.</seg>
<seg id="7"> ying, a student of popular and consumer subcultures, also became excited and said she would watch that program next week.  after all, when competition is reaching its most crucial final climax, the show will become most spectacular. taking a look at it could very well help a researcher collect materials on interesting cases essential for future research projects.</seg>
<seg id="8"> then, our conversation turned to the topic: arrival of the age of male sexual appeal.</seg>
<seg id="9"> men finally changed their status from the "observer" to the "observed." women, who played the role of "guest" in the past, have now become the "master," who can, as spectators, face down and enjoy various types of shows of the age of male sexual appeal which feature a cast of male stars.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ying said, that is liberation of women, and a signpost of feminism.</seg>
<seg id="11"> then, she added: "don't you think you are leading a highly feministic life?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> upon hearing ying's remarks, i burst out into loud laughter of joy.</seg>
<seg id="13"> these words are 100 percent feministic in themselves.  but, it takes somebody better than i, somebody like ying, who has such superior faculties of deliberation and discrimination, to explain and illuminate these things clearly and in great depth.</seg>
<seg id="14"> in "pleasant male voice" i like very much the songs of chen chusheng which are of excellent quality capable of penetrating time and space in the direction of your heart.   very pure, clean and comforting.</seg>
<seg id="15"> songs by su xing are varied in form and presented with a great deal of feeling.  his looks are elegant and graceful. meanwhile, he carries himself vivaciously and lightheartedly.</seg>
<seg id="16"> zhang jie's songs are extremely powerful and resonant. particularly, the two songs, "your looks" and "yesterday is blown away," on today's program are my old favorites impressively presented.</seg>
<seg id="17"> wei chen who closely resembles lu yi, has a lovely face pure and clear. he is believed to be very popular among young girls.  naturally, his voice is quite presentable.</seg>
<seg id="18"> with four top stars of this stature racing further upward to the summit, the show should be tremendously worth watching.</seg>
<seg id="19"> we are looking forward to watching their sensational shows next week!</seg>

<seg id="1"> topsy-turvy "pickled cabbage mood" on june 29</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key terms: pickled cabbage, seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> topsy-turvy "pickled cabbage mood" on june 29. i have international roaming, but, upon getting off the plane, i found it was like the power was cut on my cell phone. not even one line of signals was shown. perhaps for quanqiutong, its coverage meant the influence sphere of the heart. and the coverage would take effect on the day of your next payment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> for the coming days, i would temporarily lose contact with you all. ha, ha, will anybody worry about me because of this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> i opened the "secretary" in order to ascertain who was thinking of me,</seg>
<seg id="6"> no matter the thoughts were of business or of private life.</seg>
<seg id="7"> but, the question was: "who do i wish would be thinking of me?"</seg>
<seg id="8"> my heart has turned blank and empty. and i don't know the time this began to happen.</seg>
<seg id="9"> i do not understand why some people would go away even if you want to keep them, while others believe they can elbow their way in despite your wish to get rid of them. does it not sound and feel like a scene in the marketplace?</seg>
<seg id="10"> but, the heart. can you fill the heart with the "white glove" type of substitutes even if you are not allocated any room in that heart?</seg>
<seg id="11"> after all, material things and the heart just cannot be discussed on the same terms!</seg>
<seg id="12"> our car runs on the high speed freeway leading to pusan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the minister does not say a word when he is driving.  neither do i have anything to say.</seg>
<seg id="14"> after all, he understands neither chinese nor english.  and i can only say a few, a few sentences in pidgin english.</seg>
<seg id="15"> i am bored watching the computer screen and working the keyboard. inside the car, only the clicking on the keyboard and the pleasant voice of young korean ladies from the gprs navigation system. all is deadly quiet.</seg>
<seg id="16"> outside the car window, what is left for you to watch is an endless stretch of green and a grayish sky.</seg>
<seg id="17"> for me, keeping quiet seems to be out of character.</seg>
<seg id="18"> unexpectedly, the only thing that makes me feel at home in this country is the english language.</seg>
<seg id="19"> the eye-full of circles makes you nothing else but dizzy.</seg>
<seg id="20"> i think, korea definitely would not make compasses,</seg>
<seg id="21"> because there is no demand of compasses in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22"> seoul is clean, thoroughly clean, meticulously clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> only, it is too bad that in the few days in seoul i have had no time to visit any place outside the workplace and department stores. all my impressions are gained through what i see along the roads i travel.</seg>
<seg id="24"> luckily, everything is still nice and beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="25"> the korean people are strictly observing traditional courtesy, smiling methodically, and listening seriously. they are refined and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="26"> all that meet the eye are the beautiful surface layer, traditional customs, old style architecture and a national culture that is trembling with fear.</seg>
<seg id="27"> is that hypocrisy?</seg>
<seg id="28"> maybe a little hypocrisy is okay. at least all would observe decorum.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when ugly things are not in sight, people would think that they do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="30"> korean food and drinks are very good.</seg>
<seg id="31"> however, i don't like and don't understand why all the changes back and forth involve only the presentation of pickled vegetables in various forms and on different combination platters. it goes without saying, seaweed is an indispensable ingredient of all and every dish.</seg>
<seg id="32"> now, let's look at things from another angle. the korean people are really tops doing research on food and drinks. they can tell apart the pickled cabbage made and stored on the surface of the earth and that made and stored underground; and can determine with measured-by-the-minute precision the age of pickled cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="33"> all these constitute circumstantial evidences that the korean national character of meticulousness has something to do with their use of pickled cabbage from early morning to late evening.</seg>
<seg id="34"> but, i am worried. as the minister is about taking us to that japanese tofu restaurant, i wonder how will its cook combine pickled vegetables with his specialties.</seg>
<seg id="35"> recalling the chinese food we had last night, i feel like crying. it is completely "koreanized" and the only thing that could pass muster was pickled cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="36"> ah huh, thanks to the china southern airline for the pickled cabbage it offered on the in-flight menu.</seg>
<seg id="37"> the airline must have presumed that i wish to accustom myself to the korean delicacy right from the time i board the korea-bound aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="38"> there are two more days to go before i return home. in case i still have nobody on my mind, i'd do well thinking of our maid who serves a dish of good chinese pork stew.</seg>
<seg id="39"> after all, to fill one's stomach is more direct and immediate fulfillment than to satisfy the needs of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> naturally, this point has nothing to do with pickled cabbage.</seg>

<seg id="1"> two trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> there are two trees. one is me; one is my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> we provide each other shade, and help and care for each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> in my generation, families bring up many sons and daughters.  but i have no brothers, only sisters -- elder and younger sisters. therefore, it apparently appears to be a very important occasion when a brother-in-law arrives.</seg>
<seg id="5"> we were children from poor families who had to do the countless household chores ever since very young ages. i tried hard to put up a grown-up fa莽ade and  to perform like a skillful old hand, but, what i did never could win a nod of approval from my dad.</seg>
<seg id="6"> ever since early childhood, i have been bothered by the symptoms of sleepwalking, which were not very serious.  but, while doing house work, the wondering mind inevitably pop up, now and then.</seg>
<seg id="7"> once dad wanted me to apply some plaster on the chimney of our old house. i hurried up to the top of the roof to do the job.</seg>
<seg id="8"> the plastering job was done. but when it rained, the roof sprang a leak because i stepped on a few tiles and broke them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> another instance began as dad asked me to replace a light bulb, an old-fashioned unfrosted light bulb.</seg>
<seg id="10"> after i climbed up a stool, the new bulb slipped out of my hand dropped down to the cement floor and was smashed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> i lost count of such little incidents. consequent to the numerous blunders i committed, my brother-in-law, soon after being welcomed to the house, took over house chores, all and sundry, as a matter of course. and, he did them with flying colors at hardly any labor cost.</seg>
<seg id="12"> as to me, it meant happy times to hide myself in a corner of the house to enjoy "xian shu," (books for killing time) which looks and feels like bricks.</seg>
<seg id="13"> later on, we grew into two big trees that are strong enough to support the building that was our family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> but, my father, on the other hand, inevitably saw his stature began and kept on shrinking. finally, dad in the wheel chair became a thick growth of shrubs that stays quiet and unnoticed in the deep shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> unexpectedly, fate, like the weather, suddenly altered its course. the 50-year-old brother-in-law, all of a sudden, was afflicted with a serious disease.  still looking luxuriant, this huge tree, however, was drawing incredibly close to its horrible end, death.</seg>
<seg id="16"> on a dazzling summer day, outside the operating room of the beijing union hospital, the surgeon casually said: the case is not worth operating.</seg>
<seg id="17"> he has, at the most, two more months to live.</seg>
<seg id="18"> right at this instant, i was dumfound, feeling like being struck by a stray bullet that separated my soul from the body.</seg>
<seg id="19"> again, somnambulism began to rear its head. i saw the courtyard of our old house and my young brother-in-law busily moving about there.</seg>
<seg id="20"> then, awakened by a shrilling cry from my elder sister, i hurried to the hallway in the hospital where she fell down and sat on the ground. i helped her up and embraced her while tears streamed down our cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="21"> the dazzling sun suddenly disappeared. and the scene just in front of my eyes turned black in fits and starts.</seg>
<seg id="22"> after coming back to our hometown, my brother-in-law soon found out the true condition of his illness.  holding my sister in his arms, he joined her in a good and unrestrained cry.  after that, he unexpectedly regained his calm and freedom from anxieties.</seg>
<seg id="23"> my brother-in-law began methodically to make arrangements for the family for the time after his departure from this world.  for instance, he would tell his son to "take good care of the grandma on behalf of me."  "after grandma passes away, bury her remains in your grandpa's grave."  and he gave instructions on how to open that grave to prepare for the burial of both grandparents together.</seg>
<seg id="24"> "pay frequent visits on your maternal grandfather.  bring him useful and practical gifts on new year's and other festival holidays."</seg>
<seg id="25"> also, he told my younger sister "to visit your elder sister often after i am gone.  all by herself, she must be very lonely and lonesome."</seg>
<seg id="26"> i tried to allocate as much time as possible to visit with him.  he was usually embarrassed when we were together face to face.</seg>
<seg id="27"> we often faced each other silently, as two trees would.  though living, they cannot talk to each other.</seg>
<seg id="28"> they are two grown-up trees. wind-swept and rain-soaked, we are past masters of facing the world of trials and tribulations. was it still necessary for him to tell me anything more?</seg>
<seg id="29"> it seemed unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="30"> for your heart understands: after you are gone, my sister, and the children you two brought to this world, in fact, the entire family, will have to lean on me, one of the two trees left standing.</seg>
<seg id="31"> who makes the decision that i be born a man!</seg>
<seg id="32"> as a man, you must, like it or not, resolutely keep your backbone upright and lift the burdens up on your shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="33"> the only regret i have is: why did you, the other tree, wither away so early when you should still live a life of abundance and luxuriant growth in your sun-set years that were to come?</seg>
<seg id="34"> you departed this world on the new year's day on the lunar calendar.</seg>
<seg id="35"> that is the festival spring holiday celebrated by chinese communities all over the world.   but, you took your leave, all alone.</seg>
<seg id="36"> perhaps, in another world and under a new framework of time and space, is another new life being born?</seg>

<seg id="1"> n minutes in life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> the reason that i came up with such a seemingly fashionable title is that the befuddled brain had no time to trifle with counting the minutes when the world was plunging into the depth of utter despair.</seg>
<seg id="3"> like an innocent person suddenly receives, out of the blue, a court sentence of capital punishment. will he try to pick out, in a leisurely manner, the grammatical mistakes in the text of the sentence?</seg>
<seg id="4"> on a winter day, it was very cold in the youth hostel.</seg>
<seg id="5"> nobody knew who was on duty.  throughout the day, the stove remained unlit.</seg>
<seg id="6"> since a strong earthquake was said to be imminent, we did not bother to kindle the stove when we returned to our den early in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="7"> on the long bunk which could accommodate 12 people, the four of us, bundled in cotton quilts, and shivering all over from severe cold, were playing the poker game "three to one" under dim light, betting with our meal coupons.</seg>
<seg id="8"> all of a sudden, a noise which started far away was rolling nearer and nearer.  in a split second, we exchanged staring glances and realized that catastrophe was descending on us.</seg>
<seg id="9"> consequently, throwing away the cards in our hand, jumping down from the bunk, together we dashed through two narrow doors out of the room.</seg>
<seg id="10"> at the very blink we cleared the dormitory building, the poor hut of piled-up stone was instantaneously pulverized.</seg>
<seg id="11"> after dashing into the courtyard, we found the ground swinging under our feet the way a boat does. like a toy tumbler, the world rocked back and forth unable to find a firm footing.</seg>
<seg id="12"> in a matter of seconds, buildings all around us, contrary to its old image of solid stability, creaked, whined, performed the mad dance number, "thunderclap," and finally turned themselves into a spiral of smoke and floating dust in an act of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the power-lines above our head, naturally, would like to join the crowd.  they snapped with a sharp cracking sound, and, like horse whips, flew wildly in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> and all around us, the devastating earth tremors were celebrating their novel accomplishment with fireworks.  multi-colored flashes of light emissions from the earth easily beat the special effects of all elaborate blockbuster war movies in beauty and impressiveness. sounds of the earthquake rolling on in all directions like the beating of battle-field drums severely strained one's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="15"> at that juncture, everybody had the same idea on his mind: "the last day for mankind has arrived!"</seg>
<seg id="16"> i could imagine that a yawning gap was opening up on the ground under our feet. there in, boiling lava hissed like molten iron to issue a fiery invitation. innumerable numbers of humans, looking like ants, were dropping down into the lava in a free fall. they disappeared in a split second, without being generous enough to leave behind even a streak of blue smoke.</seg>
<seg id="17"> my spine became happily numb as if someone had injected ice water in the column. in the darkness, faces of my companions looked like paper masks drifting and floating about unsteadily.</seg>
<seg id="18"> i asked myself: is mankind taking leave of this beautiful and interesting world? is the civilization of myriads of years to be completely wiped out overnight?</seg>
<seg id="19"> but, i am not yet 20 years old. the flower of youth has just started to blossom. the delight of life is barely discovered. oh, how reluctant i am to say goodbye to this world!</seg>
<seg id="20"> oh, my dad, mom and all my loved ones, where are you? what are you doing at this moment?  are you still alive?</seg>
<seg id="21"> faced with the terrifying and gloating smiles of the god of death, how i yearn over all of you!</seg>
<seg id="22"> . . . . i did not know how long this lasted.  finally, the empty-headed me was delighted to discover that the rolling noise transmitted through the ground was gradually diminishing, earth tremors were slowing down and the smoke and spark overhead also stopped blinking.</seg>
<seg id="23"> the huge ship tumbling in the sky-high waves and frightful storm was finally inching her way into a peaceful harbor.</seg>
<seg id="24"> having just weathered a maddening battle, a young and easily breakable heart was finally and carefully returned to its original position.</seg>
<seg id="25"> oh my earth! my home and garden! finally, you made us feel again the warmth and care of our home!</seg>
<seg id="26"> born of our survival of a catastrophe, a feeling of joy and good fortune slowly spread out from both heels upward through the entire body</seg>
<seg id="27"> after regaining his foothold, yu doudou who was barely 17 years old, suddenly cried out loud. for he simply could not bear to see the once warm and harmonious youth hostel now reduced to a huge pile of debris and ruins.</seg>
<seg id="28"> the highly contagious mood was transmitted to all people present. and tears swelled into a torrent.</seg>
<seg id="29"> snow began to fall down from the firmament. was it expressing sadness and mourning for the victimized mankind?</seg>
<seg id="30"> that year, earthquake took more than 1,000 lives in haicheng.</seg>
<seg id="31"> some experts say it was extremely fortunate that there were timely forecasts and that the quake took place before most people went to bed.  otherwise, the quake measuring 7.3 on the richter scale would have taken a toll of at least one hundred thousand lives</seg>
<seg id="32"> only one year later, an earthquake shook up tangshan and killed more than 200,000 people.</seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> things happened in village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> in the village there are many families.  of them, the family named nan is the most disliked.  a well-known phrase widely circulated in the village says: "guard against fire, robbers and the nans."</seg>
<seg id="3"> in fact, the whole nan clan may be counted as relatively honest.</seg>
<seg id="4"> ordinarily, some families would swipe something, such as melons, from the field of other people.  all that the nan family does are no worse than pilfering a chicken or stealing a dog.  it shouldn't have come to the point that the whole village shuns and tries to isolate the nan family.</seg>
<seg id="5"> no body is clean. who have we of the nan clan offended?</seg>
<seg id="6"> the nan family has begun to engage in a number of prideful activities, demonstrating that the village, in its earliest beginning, was founded by ancestors of the nan clan which has always been a large grain producing household.  moreover, it has produced quite a number of celebrities in history, and, additionally, made important contributions to the development and construction in the village.</seg>
<seg id="7"> in the meantime, members of the nan family warmly and anxiously invite cadres of the village to come for visits and to look around.</seg>
<seg id="8"> all in all, members of the entire nan clan strive for progress resolutely. they want to take the initiative in a battle and to strive for power and strength.</seg>
<seg id="9"> not very long ago, the xi family did something that was rather mean: -- cruelly persecuting the young sprouts of the nan family.</seg>
<seg id="10"> the family named xi is well known in the whole village through their work of match-making. all young men benefited from such work by the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="11"> without the good match-making service performed by xi family members, how can you, members of all families, do a good job in production?</seg>
<seg id="12"> but in recent days members of the xi family, to the surprise of other villagers, used black bricks to squeeze out the life of young sprouts brought forth by the nan family.  that action was extremely abominable.  the whole village rose in anger and said that the xi family did not even have one good and decent family member.</seg>
<seg id="13"> the nans demanded that the xi family give them an explanation.  that touched off a wave of sympathy and support for the nans throughout the village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> one after another, virtually all villagers spit on the members of the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="15"> this way, the battlefield is transferred to the xi family.</seg>
<seg id="16"> the nan family made a firm decision to give a good shine to the image of the clan before the opening of the 17th plenary conference of the village. they wanted to help the clan, which had more members than other clans in the village, to grow and prosper in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17"> although cadres of the village try, day in and day out, to persuade everybody to keep inter-personal relationships harmonious, life in the place that we know as zhong village, however, is far from peaceful and tranquil.</seg>
<seg id="18"> in a short period of two to three months, the most irritating thing that happened is the revolt proclaimed boisterously by the pigs. even pigs wish to raise themselves in others' esteem.</seg>
<seg id="19"> two years ago, chickens spread bird flu in many villages.  weren't they all liquidated?</seg>
<seg id="20"> poor pig, don't you have brains in the head?</seg>
<seg id="21"> don't you dare to further instigate a revolution! that will deny you a chance to escape the fate of decapitation.</seg>
<seg id="22"> in the village of mei and in the village of ying, two habitual bullies, life has been blessed by wealth and abundance but not necessarily by peace and harmony.</seg>
<seg id="23"> in the village of mei, some vagabonds knock down a couple of skyscrapers today.  tomorrow they throw boxfuls of dynamite on underground rail tracks in the village of ying.  these are frightening enough, aren't they?</seg>
<seg id="24"> these things have enabled people in the villages of shang and zhong to reach the following conclusion: though they cannot afford decent housing, sick calls, medical care and opportunities to receive education, they are able to work on farms and in factories and can build up their social network in peace and good conscience.  this means these villages have already ushered in the modern age.</seg>
<seg id="25"> there are the nan family, the xi family, and many others.  which one of them can claim to be completely free from difficulties and problems?</seg>
<seg id="26"> take a look at the wan family in the southeastern part of the village.  though the head of this clan is shameless and dishonorable, our great village of zhong, still takes good care of them just the same?</seg>
<seg id="27"> the inter-village games of 2008 will be held in our village of zhong very soon.  let some of the unworthy problems in the village be cleared away.  and let the naughty children of the village be disciplined.</seg>
<seg id="28"> let all the families and households light their lamps and kindle their fires.  let the wealthy chip in with their monies and the able-bodied pledge their muscle power.</seg>
<seg id="29"> when the time comes, let us go to the bird nest to see the gold eggs.</seg>
<seg id="30"> (sound effect off screen, phasing out: gold eggs or silver eggs?  friends in the audience, the audience,  this is yongge, a program host of the village tv station)</seg>

<seg id="2"> key words: eric, google, google china.  author: an ordinary google employee</seg>
<seg id="3"> i am an employee who joined google china rather early.  in the recent two years we went through a lot of tests. some of them were expected beforehand, but others, for sure, happened unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="4"> yesterday, since the corporate earnings report of this quarter, it is learned, would devote a special chapter to reporting developments in china, and, by chance, heard corporate ceo, eric's answer to a question about china.  the remarks by eric provided me with a lot of food for thought which i have just located and am sharing with you now.</seg>
<seg id="5"> these remarks were made in the google inc. second quarter 2007 earnings conference call last week.(http://investor.google.com/earnings.html )  in answer to a reporter's question ceo eric said he was completely satisfied with current accomplishments of google china and had a full measure of confidence in google's future development in the chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> eric said: in china we have excellent talents, constantly upgraded  equipment and installations as well as incessantly enriched and localized production lines.</seg>
<seg id="7"> predicting no immediate and surefire success just in front of our eyes, eric, however, said google china already had a very good start. and, with hard work by the chinese team, generous support from the headquarters and plenty of perseverance, he was convinced that google china will certainly achieve astonishing results in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8"> yes, it is essential that we march onward and upward resolutely, for we were born and brought up here and we are deeply attached to this place.  we firmly believe that google should give a great deal more to china and to its customers.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> now, for whatever merchandise, top-less is all the rage, especially in the summer. everyone wishes to run around in the nude, for any piece of clothing would make the wearer that much hotter.</seg>
<seg id="3"> you probably learned sometime ago that t-back which was popular for quite a number of years was knocked out by g-string, because the latter has no string at all.</seg>
<seg id="4"> for the same reason, and in this day, the slippers you are wearing will quite likely become out-dated, because a brand new type, the string-less slipper, has made its appearance. it consists of nothing else but the sole.</seg>
<seg id="5"> how to wear that without a string?</seg>
<seg id="6"> we are not god. manufacturers also have no magic.</seg>
<seg id="7"> this kind of slippers is directly glued to the sole: this is not prank, but real merchandise. its selling price is around us$13.5 per pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> this is another kind of "i have imagined it could exist, but never dreamed of its real existence" product. it leaves me speechless.</seg>
<seg id="9"> manufacturers consider this kind of slippers to be extremely cool. don't you believe them?</seg>
<seg id="10"> please take a look.  just glancing at it is enough to make the sole of my feet extremely uncomfortable. [via f.c]</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> key term: cell phone</seg>
<seg id="3"> the korean company iljin display is introducing a coin-sized laser projector module.</seg>
<seg id="4"> due to its extremely small size, the projector module, capable of creating a 7-in display area on the wall, can be installed inside a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> a traditional projector has three different lcd panels to project respectively three different, namely red, green, and blue, video signals. but this tiny projector needs only one lcd panel to switch back and forth among the three colors, thus reduces both the size and the production cost of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> an official statement said since the lcd panel used in this projector module measures only 0.24 inches, the module can be integrated easily inside a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> now, over half of the cell phones on the market have cameras built in. and it is foreseen that cell phones with built-in projectors will appear on the market very soon. but it is really very difficult to predict if the market will or will not receive this new device with enthusiasm.</seg>
