</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> xinhua news agency, johannesburg, march 18 (reporter gao yuan) motlanthe, secretary general of african national congress (anc), the ruling party of south africa, criticized here on the 18th the western nations such as the united states and britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force zimbabwe into following the will of the western nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> in response to the western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against zimbabwe, motlanthe told the press: "who should rule zimbabwe is zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the western nations." </seg>
<seg id=4> he pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and anc strongly opposes the western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> if the western nations impose further sanctions against zimbabwe, motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in zimbabwe. </seg>
<seg id=6> he called on the government of zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis. </seg>
<seg id=7> he emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split zimbabwe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> earlier, anc had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> mugabe, president of zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from march 9 to march 11. however, the western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom. they therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against zimbabwe. </seg>
<seg id=10> at present, some western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to zimbabwe. </seg>
<seg id=11> before the election, eu nations cited zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against zimbabwe. </seg>

<seg id=1> jordan to come back from his recovery of injury as early as sunday </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> xinhua news agency, washington, march 19 (reporter xie peiling) "air jordan" is expected to come back as early as sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery. however, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for washington wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> the wizards coach collins revealed today that jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up. although he does not yet want to show up in denver and salt lake city on wednesday and thursday, he is very likely to go to toronto to re-don his wizards outfit and challenge the raptors that is currently not in a good shape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> collins said: "he may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels. </seg>
<seg id=5> currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket. </seg>
<seg id=6> he plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment. </seg>
<seg id=7> as far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> jordan has averaged a score of 24.3 during this season. he underwent the surgery three weeks ago. in the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8.  </seg>
<seg id=9> at present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season. the wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the nba eastern conference. it lagged half a game behind the miami heat, one game in advance of the raptors, but is still two and half games away from charlotte hornets that ranked 8th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> naturally, coach collins in particular hopes jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games. </seg>
<seg id=11> collins said: "if jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time. </seg>
<seg id=12> judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team." </seg>

<seg id=2> (taipei) a year and half have passed since the plane crash of the singapore airlines, yet aviation safety council of taiwan (asc) has delayed the investigation report on the plane crash again and again, stalling the investigation by taoyuan district prosecutor's office and causing the prosecutors to smell a rat. as for asc, it has promised to deliver the investigation report in april. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> at 11:18 p.m. on october 31, 2000, the singapore airlines flight sq-006 at chiang kai-shek airport bound for los angeles entered by error the runway #05 on the right side during take-off and crashed into the two digging machines and exploded, killing 83 passengers and injuring nearly a hundred passengers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> china times reported yesterday that taoyuan district prosecutor's office in charge of prosecuting for criminal liability after the plane crash has had several disputes over the right to investigate with asc investigation unit. </seg>
<seg id=5> since the plane crash, wang tiensheng, former chief prosecutor of taoyuan prosecutor's office, has been promoted to chief prosecutor of taichong. chen shouhuang serves as his replacement. the case prosecutor huang moushin has also been transferred to taipei prosecutor's office, handing over the case to chiang yuanchen. </seg>
<seg id=6> meanwhile, the original due date of the investigation report at the end of last year promised by asc was postponed to the end of january. after the end of january, it was again changed to february. so far there has been no news. urged by the prosecutors, asc now promises to deliver the report in april. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> as los angeles was the destination of flight sq-006, some of the victims' families have already taken the case to the us court for huge sums of civil compensation, suing not only singapore airlines but also taiwan civil aviation administration. </seg>
<seg id=8> the lawsuit by the victims' families for compensation is tantamount to accusing taiwan aviation administration's control tower of negligence of duty. therefore, the result of the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor's office will draw all the more attention. </seg>

<seg id=3> it is estimated that in beijing alone, more than 150 north koreans are waiting for their chances to go to south korea. the authorities have stepped up security on major embassies such as those of south korea, japan and western nations in the embassy district so as to prevent "storming" incidents from happening again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> singtao reported yesterday that public security sources indicated that since 25 north koreans stormed the spanish embassy by surprise on march 14, beijing police, in addition to the increased security it has provided to those embassies of sensitive nations, has further stepped up protection for the embassies of non-sensitive nations while maintaining a closer contact with the officials of north korean and south korean embassies in beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> the sources pointed out, staff from the south korean embassy indicated to the chinese officials that south korea does not encourage north koreans to go to south korea through this means and south korea does not hope to see similar incidents again so that the relations between china and the korean peninsula are not affected. south korea also promises china that it will assist china in managing the south korean residents in beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> it is disclosed that about 10,000 ethnic koreans live in the eastern district of beijing and liangmahe in chaoyang district. among them are ethnic koreans from northeast china and those from north and south koreas. they are mainly engaged in korean style restaurant and bar businesses. since they belong to the same korean ethnic group, they get along quite well with each other no matter where they come from. </seg>
<seg id=7> in the past, the authorities did not consider the ethnic koreans as the focus of their supervision because they were not big in number in beijing, nor did they get involved in so many criminal offenses like those people from xinjiang and henan. </seg>
</p>

<seg id=8> it is reported that after the march 14 incident, the public security agency first "invited" the german doctor who assisted those 25 north koreans for a "talk" at the public security agency and then escorted him to the airport for immediate departure from china. </seg>
<seg id=9> afterwards, the public security agency and the national security agency started an internal review. </seg>
<seg id=10> the review mainly consists of two parts: the security protection of the embassy district and the management of the ethnic koreans in beijing. </seg>

<seg id=1> interior minister confirms senior italian government advisor shot by "red brigade" </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (rome, afp) italian interior minister scajola confirmed the day before yesterday that the senior italian government advisor biagi was shot to death by a branch unit of the extremist left-wing guerrilla "red brigade." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> scajola said, the two men who killed biagi even used the same pistol that was used to carry out a similar political assassination three years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> on the other hand, after biagi's assassination, the italian prime minister berlusconi offered to invite the labor union leaders back to the negotiation table and to discuss the employment reform plan he proposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> biagi, the 52-year-old advisor for the ministry of labor, was also an economist and law professor. </seg>
<seg id=6> he was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle when he was riding his bike back to his home in the northern city of bologna. the shooting shocked the italian political circle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> biagi had assisted in drafting an employment reform plan that was strongly opposed by the labor union and the leftists. </seg>
<seg id=8> they believed the plan would make it easier for employers to fire workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> eyewitnesses said that biagi was lying in a pool of blood alongside his briefcase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> the door of biagi's home was also found to be carved with a red brigade symbol of five stars, but at this time it is not clear when the symbol was carved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> established in 1973, red brigade was suspected in many bombings and assassinations in italy during the 70s and 80s, including the abduction and murder of the former prime minister moro in 1978. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (beijing, ap) beijing no.1 intermediate people's court yesterday sentenced the chinese american engineer fang fuming to 5 years in prison on charges of illegally obtaining state secrets and bribing on behalf of a company. </seg>
<seg id=3> the case had aroused protests from the united states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> the spokesman for the us embassy in china said that fang fuming will be deported from china after he serves his time. </seg>
<seg id=5> the time of his sentence will be adjusted according to the time he has already served. </seg>
<seg id=6> the us embassy had sent a diplomat to attend the hearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> the attorney representing fang fuming said that his client has already been imprisoned for two years, but china said it was not that long. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> xinhua news agency confirmed the ruling. </seg>
<seg id=9> it said, from 1995 to 1999, fang fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets and gave 245,000 us dollars (about 450,000 singapore dollars in current value) in bribes to state workers to assist foreign investors bidding for china's power construction projects.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> fang fuming was an electrical engineering consultant for a foreign company in its china and other asian offices. </seg>
<seg id=11> cohen, the attorney representing fang fuming, said that fang fuming denied giving bribes and said he was a victim to the embezzling chinese officials in the power industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> once a chinese official in the power industry, fang fuming became a us citizen in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=13> in the past two years, a number of us citizens and residents were accused of violating the chinese national security laws. fang fuming was one of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> the arrest of fang fuming had temporarily caused tensions between china and the united states. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (beijing, syndicated news) the sino-us relation that was heated momentarily by the us president bush's visit to china is cooling down rapidly. china confirmed yesterday that it has called off its naval fleet visit to the us ports this year and refused to confirm whether the country's vice president hu jintao will visit the united states as planned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> the foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said while answering reporters' questions at a routine press conference: "as far as i know, china's naval fleet is preparing for a visit as planned; its itinerary does not include the us ports." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> when a reporter asked her twice whether hu jintao's plan to visit the united states is affected and whether she can clarify that an earlier answer can be interpreted as an indication that hu jintao will visit the us in april as scheduled, zhang qiyue would not make any further comments nor would she confirm anything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> zhang qiyue only repeatedly accused the us of "doing a series of things that violate the three joint communiques between china and the us" within a short period of one month after president bush's visit to china and demanded that the us "stop using the issue of taiwan to interfere in china's internal affairs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> on the other hand, in washington d.c., the us ignored on wednesday china's warning that a "chilly wind" is blowing over the sino-us relations and insisted that there is nothing wrong with the us permission of taiwan's defense minister to attend "us-taiwan defense summit" held in florida. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> beijing repeatedly attacked the us for issuing a visa to taiwan's defense minister tang yiau-ming earlier this month and allowing him to attend a conference sponsored by the us arms manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id=8> tang yiau-ming also met with two senior us officials at the time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> at a routine press conference, state department spokesman boucher was hounded by reporters asking about china's complaints over this issue, but obviously he was trying his best to avoid a battle of words with china. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> he said: "after this meeting, our position is well-known to all. </seg>
<seg id=11> if you want to ask me about this every day, i am willing to explain it every day. if china wants to ask about this every day, we are willing to explain it every day." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> he said: "the position hasn't changed. these are our normal contacts with the taiwanese. we will continue to do so." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> zhang qiyue also confirmed yesterday the russian media's report, saying that the chinese president jiang zemin called the russian president putin by phone at his request the night before, and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between china and russia based on mutual benefits. </seg>

<seg id=3> despite costly environmental efforts to halt the advance of the desert to beijing, sandstorms continue their frequent annual assault on the capital city. sandstorms look like to remain a serious challenge to beijing, which is going to host the 2008 olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> according to china meteorological administration's forecasts, the year's first sandstorm struck beijing last friday with further windy cold fronts from the mongolian steppe expected to shroud beijing in a yellow, dusty haze.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "i cannot say sandstorms won't occur in 2008," yang weixi (transliteration), chief engineer of the desertification control center of china's ministry of forestry told the beijing weekend publication.  </seg>
<seg id=6> "what we can do is to manage the man-made factors which cause sandstorms and the expansion of desertification," he said.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> however, conditions beyond human control, like wind, drought and huge existing deserts, would make it impossible to get rid of the storms in a short time frame, yang said.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> the chinese government has committed to spend renminbi 56.8 billion (about singapore dollars 12.376 billion) to curb desertification and lessen sandstorms between 2002 and 2008. </seg>
<seg id=9> beijing alone will spend approximately renminbi 1 billion (about singapore dollars 220 million) this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> "the increase in funding will greatly improve the situation, but... it may take decades to see a gradual improvement," an expert of the china forestry research institute said.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> chinese environmentalists raised alarm bells after a survey earlier this year, which found almost a third of the country's land mass is now desert largely due to human economic activity, such as livestock overgrazing.  </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> according to reports in hong kong newspapers, the center commenced verification services since may this year. it has so far examined more than 3,500 certificates and more than 800 certificates are found to be forgeries of one kind or the other. that is a forging rate of 23%. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> taipei news -- the singapore airlines crash had happened for more than one and half years. however, taiwan's aviation safety council (sac) has delayed the release of its final report several times, which has effectively made the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor's office to a standstill. the prosecutor's office is challenging the rationale and sac has now undertaken to release a report before end of april. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> on october 31, 2000 at 11:18 pm, singapore airlines' sq-006 attempted to take off from chiang kai shek international airport for los angeles. in the course of the take off, the plane entered 05-right runway. the plane then hit two dredgers that were on the runway. the impact caused an explosion and the death of 83 passengers. more than 100 passengers were injured in the accident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "china times" reported yesterday: the taoyuan prosecutor's office has been investigating for possible criminal liabilities in parallel to a probe into the cause of the crash by sac. unfortunately, the two have several disputes over investigation rights. </seg>
<seg id=5> from the date of the crash till now, taoyuan district court chief prosecutor wang teng-sheng in charge of the case was promoted chief prosecutor for taichung. chen sou-huang filled his position. the case was then taken over by prosecutor huang mo-hsin but he was also transferred to taipei later. the case is currently the responsibility of chiang yuan-chen. </seg>
<seg id=6> sac originally says that they can complete the investigation by the end of last year. sac subsequently delayed the report to end of january. by january, sac changed the report date to end of february and there is no further news since then. after pressed by the prosecutor's office, sac has now undertaken to delver a report by the end of april. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> the destination of sq-006 was los angeles and some passengers are americans. hence, some family members of passengers who died in the crash have already commenced legal actions in u.s. courts for damages against singapore airlines and also in some cases, against taiwan's civil aeronautics administration. </seg>
<seg id=8> the claims by family members are equivalent to an accusation of negligence on the part of taiwan's civil aeronautics administration. hence, the conclusion of the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor's office becomes important. </seg>

<seg id=1> china has tightened security in embassy areas to prevent north koreans from 'storming embassy' again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> hong kong news -- chinese police has recently conducted an internal review on the incident last week in which 25 north koreans dashed inside the spanish embassy. </seg>
<seg id=3> it is estimated that there are more than 150 north koreans waiting for opportunity to go to south korea in beijing alone. the authorities have tightened security in embassy areas, especially around south korea, japan and other major western embassies, in order to prevent further 'storming of embassy'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> notwithstanding beijing police has already tightened security for embassies of sensitive countries after '911', china has taken a step further and beef up security for embassies of non-sensitive countries as well. sing tao daily reported this new measure yesterday quoting information from ministry of public security. china is clearly making a response to the raid on spanish embassy by 25 north koreans on march 14. meanwhile, it is understood that china has also strengthened its contacts with embassy officials of the two koreas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> according to information sources, south korea diplomats have indicated to chinese officials that they do not support any 'storming of embassy' by north koreans as a means to get to south korea. south korea does not wish to see such kind of incident to happen again. in order not to affect the relations between china and two sides in the korea peninsula, south korea has undertaken to assist china to better manage koreans in beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> as disclosed, there are approximately ten thousand north korea nationals living in beijing's dongcheng district and the liangmahe of chaoyang district. some of them are ethnic north koreans coming from northeast china. others have come from either north korea or south korea. they are mainly engaged in running north korean restaurants and bars. thus, they can get along with one another irrespective of where they have come from. </seg>
<seg id=7> there were not so many north koreans in beijing in the past. also, unlike those from xinjiang and henan, who often involve in criminal acts, north koreans were not key monitoring targets of the authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> reportedly, public security has 'invited' the german doctor, who has assisted the 25 north koreans, to their office for a 'talk' right after the incident on march 14. soon afterwards, public security has sent him to the airport and the doctor has to leave immediately. </seg>
<seg id=9> after the doctor is gone, public security and the state security department have conducted an internal review. </seg>
<seg id=10> the review involved two main areas: first, security in the embassy areas, and second, the management of north koreans in beijing. </seg>
<seg id=11> meanwhile, the authorities have also requested relevant departments in jilin areas to take more effective measures to stop illegal north korea immigrants from getting to beijing. </seg>

<seg id=2> associated press, melbourne and florida -- an asteroid, large enough to flatten an average city, brushed past the earth within a short range of 463,000 kilometers, but was not discovered in time. it was four days after the close shave could astronomers tell about it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> this asteroid, about 50 meters in diameter, was flying from the direction of the sun, thus astronomers could hardly detect it. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> williams of the international astronomical union's minor planet center in cambridge, massachusetts, has helped in determining the astronomical position of this asteroid. </seg>
<seg id=6> from the astronomical point of view, this asteroid was very close to the earth because the moon is only 402,000 kilometers away from the earth. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> scajola said that the two gunmen even used a similar pistol that was used in another political assassination 3 years ago to gun down biagi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> on the other side, italian prime minister silvio berlusconi, after biagi's assassination, has voluntarily invited union leaders to return to the negotiating table for discussions on biagi's proposed labor reform plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> the 52-year-old labor ministry advisor was an economist and a professor in the science of law. </seg>
<seg id=6> he was on tuesday night shot to death by two motorcyclists outside his home in the northern city of bologna right after he biked home. the news shocked the italian political circles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> biagi had helped in drafting a labor reform proposal that provoked strong protests from labor unions and the leftists. </seg>
<seg id=8> they thought that the proposal would make it easier for employers to layoff workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> a witness said that biagi was lying in a pool of blood, with his briefcase on the side. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> associated press, beijing -- the beijing no. 1 people's intermediate court yesterday sentenced chinese-american engineer fang fuming to 5 years imprisonment. fang was convicted for illegally obtaining state secrets and paying bribes on behalf of a company. </seg>
<seg id=3> this case has brought about us protests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> a us embassy spokesman said that fang fuming would be deported after serving the sentence. </seg>

<seg id=6> the us embassy has sent a diplomat to attend the trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> fang fuming's lawyer said that his client has already been detained for 2 years, but china said not that long. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> xinhua news agency confirmed the sentence. </seg>
<seg id=9> the agency said that fang fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets from 1995 to 1999. fang gave chinese state workers usd245,000 (about 450,000 singapore dollars in current value) in bribes so as to assist foreign investors in bidding for chinese power projects. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> fang fuming used to be an official in china's electrical authority until he became a us citizen in 1994. </seg>

<seg id=2> comprehensive report, beijing -- the once warming up sino-us relations attained by us president bush's china visit is rapidly cooling off. china confirmed yesterday the cancellation of its fleet visit to us ports this year. china also refused to say if vice president hu jintao would visit us as scheduled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> when asked in a press conference, chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said, "as much as i know, chinese navel vessels are preparing their fleet for visits as planned. however, us ports are not on their plans." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> zhang qiyue merely accused the us side for repeatedly 'violating the promises laid out in the three sino-us joint communiques in a series of moves' just within a month after bush's china visit. she also requested the us side 'to stop using the taiwan issue in meddling china's internal affairs.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> on the other side, in washington on wednesday, the us paid no attention to china's warning about the 'icy breeze' being blown over sino-us relations. us insisted that there is nothing wrong to allow taiwan's defense minister to attend the 'us-taiwan defense summit' in florida. </seg>

<seg id=3> although the government has invested huge funds improving beijing's environment and trying to keep desert off beijing, it is still a major problem faced by the city where the 2008 olympics is to be held. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> yang weixi, chief engineer of the desert control centre of the ministry of forestry of china told beijing weekly: "i dare not say there will not be sandstorms in 2008.  </seg>
<seg id=6> what we can do is to control the human factors that contribute to sandstorms and prevent desertification of the environment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> he said, however, natural factors like wind, drought and big deserts that are beyond the control of human beings make it impossible for china to prevent sandstorms in any short term. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> china's environmental experts, after making surveys early this year, warned that about one third of china's territory is desert, which was caused mainly by human's economic activities such as overgrazing. </seg>

<seg id=4> sing tao daily reported yesterday that sources to the public security agencies said beijing police has extended guarding from some sensitive countries after the september 11 attack to those less sensitive countries and stepped up liaison with beijing-based staff of the embassies of dprk and rok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> sources said rok embassy personnel told chinese officials that rok has not backed any dpr koreans to get to rok in such a manner and rok would not like such things happen again to affect relationship between china and the two sides of the korean peninsula. rok also promised to assist china in the administration of koreans in beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> it was revealed that the dongcheng district and the liangmahe area of chaoyang district of beijing are inhabited by about 10,000 koreans, most of whom are ethnic koreans from northeast china and some from dprk and rok, who mainly operate korean-style restaurants and bars. as koreans, they live in peace together regardless of where they come from.  </seg>
<seg id=7> there were not many korean nationals in beijing before and few were involved in criminal cases like people from xinjiang and henan, making them the less conspicuous target of surveillance of the authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> reports said the ministry of public security "invited" the german doctor who assisted the 25 koreans to the public security agencies to "have a talk" after the march 14 incident and sent him to the airport shortly afterwards and demanded him to leave china immediately. </seg>
<seg id=9> the public security and the state security agencies began internal review afterwards. </seg>
<seg id=10> the review was centered around two aspects: the guarding of the embassy quarters and administration of ethnic koreans in beijing. </seg>
<seg id=11> the authorities also requested related agencies in areas like jilin to take effective measures to keep koreans illegally entering chinese territory from going to beijing. </seg>

<seg id=2> (ap report from melbourne, florida) - an asteroid big enough to ruin a mid-sized city passed by in a close range of 463,000 kilometres off earth without being noticed in advance. astronomers learned of the event four days later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> the asteroid, about 50 metres in diameter, came in the direction of sun, which made it hard for astronomers to discover. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> williams from the international association of astronomy based in cambridge of massachusetts helped position the asteroid. </seg>
<seg id=6> the asteroid was very close to the earth in astronomic terms, because the moon is 402,000 kilometres off earth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> williams told the florida-based newspaper, today, on wednesday, "the key is that the asteroid should have been discovered before it started off in the direction of sun. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> biagi once helped drafting an employment reform scheme that was been strongly opposed by the trade unions and the left-wing. </seg>

<seg id=7> the lawyer representing fang fuming said his client has been jailed for two years, but china has denied the said period of jail. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> xihua news agency has confirmed the relevant judgement. </seg>
<seg id=9> it said fang fuming acquired 35 documents containing state secrets from 1995 to 1999 and bribed chinese civil servants with us$245,000 (approximate 450,000 singapore dollars) to help foreign investors bid for china's electricity projects. </seg>

<seg id=3> foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said when answering questions at the regular press conference, "as far as i know, china's naval fleet is being prepared for a planned visit, which does not include us ports." </seg>
